  On December 5th 2005, JBoss announced it acquired and would open source Java and Web Services distributed transaction management technology owned by Arjuna Technologies and HP. This move further propels the JBoss Enterprise Middleware Suite (JEMS) into the high-end market long presided over by proprietary application platforms. The acquisition includes Arjuna Transaction Service Suite (ArjunaTS), one of the most advanced transaction engines in the world with a 20-year-old pedigree, and Arjuna's Web Services Transaction implementation, the market's only implementation supporting both leading web services specifications Web Services Transaction (WS-TX) and Web Services Composite Application Framework (WS-CAF).
