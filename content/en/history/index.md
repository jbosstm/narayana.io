On December 5th 2005, JBoss announced it acquired and would open source
Java and Web Services distributed transaction management technology
owned by Arjuna Technologies and HP. This move further propels the JBoss
Enterprise Middleware Suite (JEMS) into the high-end market long
presided over by proprietary application platforms. The acquisition
includes Arjuna Transaction Service Suite (ArjunaTS), one of the most
advanced transaction engines in the world with a 20-year-old pedigree,
and Arjuna\'s Web Services Transaction implementation, the market\'s
only implementation supporting both leading web services specifications
Web Services Transaction (WS-TX) and Web Services Composite Application
Framework (WS-CAF).
