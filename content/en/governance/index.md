### Stewardship

This project is developed and released by Red Hat with assistance from
the Java developer community. The project lead is appointed by Red Hat,
and has the power to accept and reject contributions to the project and
set the roadmap. Red Hat employees assigned to work on Narayana as well
as community contributors, in this regard, all answer to the project
lead.

### Requirement Definition

The requirements and roadmap for Narayana are driven by Red Hat and by
the community. Typically, when a major release is being planned, the
project lead will take input from both Red Hat and the community, and
evaluate what can be done in the necessary time. This will define what
features will be addressed in a given release. The project lead will
then publish the roadmap on the developers mailing list, and update the
version information in JIRA.

Narayana is part of the commercial (yet open source) [JBoss Enterprise
Application
Platform](https://www.redhat.com/products/jbossenterprisemiddleware/application-platform/)
product, so many requirements for Narayana come from its users. However,
all requirements are fed into the same community process that our
community users follow. We create JIRAs for all feature requests on our
schedule.

If you are interested in EAP you can download it for free on the
[JBoss.ORG website.](https://www.jboss.org/products/eap.html)

The best way for you to suggest requirements for a future release of
Narayana is to enter a feature request in
[JIRA.](https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM) Lobbying for features
using the voting feature in JIRA, and posting to the community forums,
is a great way to express interest as well. Although, contributing is
the single most expedient way to get a capability into a particular
release.

### Release Cycle

Narayana releases frequently. We deliver frequent milestones, typically
one a month, and support building from main for those that wish to be
on the bleeding edge.

### Contribution

Narayana welcomes, thrives on and greatly values community contribution.
