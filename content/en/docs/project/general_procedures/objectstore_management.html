<h1>ObjectStore Management</h1>

<div id="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the transaction service installation, the object store is updated regularly whenever transactions are created, or when <em>Transactional Objects for Java</em> is used.
In a failure-free environment, the only object states which should reside within the object store are those representing objects created with the <em>Transactional Objects for Java</em> API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if failures occur, transaction logs may remain in the object store until crash recovery facilities have resolved the transactions they represent.
As such it is very important that the contents of the object store are not deleted without due care and attention, as this will make it impossible to resolve in doubt transactions.
In addition, if multiple users share the same object store it is important that they realize this and do not simply delete the contents of the object store assuming it is an exclusive resource.</p>
