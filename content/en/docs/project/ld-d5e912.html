                        a typical nesting of atomic actions, where action B is nested within action A. Although atomic action C is
                        logically nested within action B (it had its Begin operation invoked while B was active) because
                        it is an
                        independent top-level action, it will commit or abort independently of the other actions within the
                        structure. Because of the nature of independent top-level actions they should be used with caution and only
                        in situations where their use has been carefully examined.
