<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compensating transactions are acknowledged as a good fit for long-lived transactions.
The idea comes out of (<a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/andru/cs711/2002fa/reading/sagas.pdf">the Sagas paper, Princeton University, 1987</a>).
The concept of the original paper talks about a single node database but the concepts described can readily be applied to distributed transactions.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Structurally, applications utilising Sagas may consist of several atomic transactions each working with a separate system and with corresponding compensation handlers to deal with failures.
The Saga as a whole then presents an atomic work of unit where changes made by atomic transactions are visible immediately but in the case of failure a recovery handling is employed.
As such, saga transactions can cooperate with, but don’t mandate full ACID - within that model, they would be considered as relaxing the isolation property.
You can read a bit more in this <a href="http://jbossts.blogspot.cz/2017/06/sagas-and-how-they-differ-from-two.html">blogpost</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compensating transaction fall within backward recovery.
The compensation transaction is defined as a work of unit that consists from one or more actions.
Each action processes some work and up to that provides compensation handler with the definition of the undo-like operation.
When a failure occurs the transaction manager invokes the compensating handlers (the undo operation) to allow the application to reconcile work processed by the proper action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With regards to Narayana, and when considering its impact on the <a href="http://www.julianbrowne.com/article/viewer/brewers-cap-theorem">CAP theorem</a> which dictates us that because of network can’t be considered reliable we need to choose between one of availability or consistency, our compensations approach relaxes some degree of availability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Compensating transactions are currently implemented in Narayana in way of:</p>

<h2 id="_compensations_framework"><a class="anchor" href="#_compensations_framework"></a>2. Compensations Framework</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Narayana contains a compensations framework to assist users with developing transactional applications which require the use of compensating transactions.
The compensating transaction behaviour can be expressed using either CDI annotations or via a programmatic API.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_cdi_annotations"><a class="anchor" href="#_cdi_annotations"></a>2.1. CDI annotations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Application developer annotates methods with the CDI annotations to define actions and undo operations which are managed by Transaction Manager.
Narayana handles the state of the compensating transaction and drives undo operation if necessary.
The manner how the annotations are used is pretty similar to standard CDI transaction annotations (e.g. in Jakarta EE).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the better understanding we recommend to check the <a href="https://github.com/jbosstm/quickstart/tree/master/compensating-transactions/mongodb-simple">compensating transactions quickstart</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The “entry point” is marking a method with <code>@Compensatable</code> annotation.
This defines demarcation for the compensating transaction to start a new one, to join to an existing one or to throw exception if a compensating transaction context does not yet exist - the behaviour is the same as you can know from with the Jakarta EE <a href="https://javadoc.io/static/jakarta.platform/jakarta.jakartaee-api/10.0.0/jakarta/ejb/TransactionAttribute.html"><code>@TransactionAttribute</code></a>.
On top of that the <code>@Compensatable</code> annotation permits you to define which exception type made the transaction to be cancelled or not cancelled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the compensating transaction context exists there you can call methods marked with <code>@TxCompensate</code> and <code>@TxConfirm</code> annotations.
Both expected to be parameterized with a handler class.
That’s a class implementing either <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.CompensationHandler</code> (with definition of one method called <code>compensate</code>) or <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.ConfirmationHandler</code> (with definition of one method called <code>confirm</code>).
Handlers intercepts the execution when the transaction reaches a specific state - the <code>compensate</code> method is called when it fails or is cancelled, the <code>confirm</code> method is called when it ends successfully.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The CDI bean marking a method with <code>@TxCompensate</code>/<code>@TxConfirm</code> and the handlers can inject (<a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/3.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-3.0.html#built_in_annotation_literals">@Inject</a>) a POJO object (a DTO) marked as <code>@CompensationScoped</code>.
This annotation defines the data being set to this object in the bean in the scope of the specific compensating transaction will be available in the handlers (<code>@TxCompensate</code>/<code>@TxConfirm</code>) intercepting the compensating transaction.
It’s important the <code>@CompensationScoped</code> POJOs being implemented as <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/Serializable.html"><code>Serializable</code></a> as they are saved during transaction processing to the transaction log store.
Let’s imagine a situation where some part of the compensating transaction work is processed and JVM, where Narayana transaction manager resides, is crashed.
After the restart Narayana needs to understand the state before the crash.
That information is persisted in the transaction log store.
Narayana loads the POJO state and passes it to handlers - to get proceed with confirmation or compensation.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_list_of_available_cdi_annotations"><a class="anchor" href="#_list_of_available_cdi_annotations"></a>2.1.1. List of available CDI annotations</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>@Compensatable</code> - declaratively control compensation transaction boundaries on CDI managed beans.
This is similar to what is known from Jakarta EE world, how <a href="https://javadoc.io/static/jakarta.platform/jakarta.jakartaee-api/10.0.0/jakarta/ejb/TransactionAttribute.html">@TransactionAttribute</a> drives the global transaction behaviour.
Compensatable framework uses CDI (you can define how interacts with other compensating transaction in the scope - you can use the type as known from Jakarta EE, which means <code>MANDATORY</code>, <code>SUPPORTS</code>, <code>REQUIRED</code> etc.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@TxConfirm</code> - callback handler for confirming any work done within this annotated method, implementing <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.ConfirmationHandler</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@TxCompensate</code> - callback handler for compensating work which was done, implementing <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.CompensationHandler</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@CompensationScoped</code> - CDI bean is to be scoped to the current active compensation-based transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>@CancelOnFailure</code> - states that the compensation-based transaction must cancel, if a <code>RuntimeException</code> is thrown.
A similar effect could be achieved by setting parameter <code>cancelOn</code> of <code>@Compensatable</code> set with <code>RuntimeException</code>.
There is no timeout associated with compensatable units of work which implies that they must either run to completion or fail.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.CompensationManager</code> - compensation manager could be <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/cdi/3.0/jakarta-cdi-spec-3.0.html#built_in_annotation_literals">@Injected</a> for being able to mark the context as <code>setCompensateOnly</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_programmatic_api"><a class="anchor" href="#_programmatic_api"></a>2.1.2. Programmatic API</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The compensation framework provides a declarative API to add compensatable work and let it processed by framework.
The application programmer injects the interface <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.CompensatableAction</code> (<code>@Inject CompensatableAction</code>).
This interface contains methods to add work to the action (<code>addWork</code>) and then execute the action <code>execute</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Programmer then adds work items to the <code>CompensatableAction</code> one by one.
The <code>addWork</code> methods offers ability to specify work item, which is instance of <code>CompensatableWork</code> that declares only that the work has to define method to execute the work, and assign to the work item its <code>CompensationHandler</code> and/or <code>ConfirmationHandler</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The programmer then declares the instant when <code>CompensatableAction</code> should be executed by calling the method executes.
Execution means that work items will be executed one by one.
All work items then belong under the same compensation and in the case of failure of one item others will be compensated (of a compensation handler was declared).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_recovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_recovery"></a>2.2. Recovery</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementation of recovery for compensating transaction is not yet part of the Narayana codebase, see <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-1107">JBTM-1107</a> however the implementation is under the review.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The recovery works in the following way.
The state of participant is saved to Narayana object store (<code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.internal.ParticipantImpl</code>).
The content of the store regarding of the participant of the compensating transaction is <code>transactionId</code>, <code>participantId</code>, <code>compensationHandler</code> and <code>confirmationHandler</code>.
For handler could be persisted it needs to implement <code>java.io.Serializable</code> interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When crash of the Narayana occurs these data is restored and used during standard periodic recovery process.
For restoring handlers user has to register an implementation of interface <code>org.jboss.narayana.compensations.api.Deserializer</code>.
The implementation is then used for getting implementation of the handler class which could be later used during recovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For tracking state is used standard Narayana object store and its handling of <code>com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.StateManager</code> methods <code>save_state</code>.
Narayana manages serializing and deserializing but programmer has to implement and registered the <code>Deserializer</code> interface to get handlers restored from the object store.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_limitation"><a class="anchor" href="#_limitation"></a>2.3. Limitation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Currently, there is one limitation which is needed to be emphasized.
If you are used to work with XTS AT transactions you probably take advantage of transaction bridge functionality - ability of smoothly join XTS transaction with app server container transaction under one transparent global transaction.
This is not possible for compensating transaction.
The lack of the bridge functionality for the compensating transactions is addressed under jira <a href="https://issues.jboss.org/browse/JBTM-1099">JBTM-1099</a>.</p>
