<p>This guide covers the REST interfaces to the Narayana Transaction Manager.
The actual protocol implemented by RESTAT described in this book is taken from the draft RESTAT specification <a href="https://github.com/jbosstm/documentation/blob/master/rts/docs/REST-Atomic_v2_draft_8_comments_sept_4.pdf">https://github.com/jbosstm/documentation/blob/master/rest-tx/docs/RESTAT-v2-latest.pdf</a> . The specification is still evolving but has reached a stability level such that it can be used in real world environments.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Atomic transactions are a well-known technique for guaranteeing consistency in the presence of failures.
The ACID properties of atomic transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) ensure that even in complex business applications consistency of state is preserved, despite concurrent accesses and failures.
This is extremely useful fault-tolerance technique, especially when multiple, possibly remote resources are involved.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consistency is especially important in a web application with dynamic servers.
When users navigate a web application, they are viewing snapshots of the server state.
If the snapshot is computed within a transaction, the state returned to the user is consistent.
For many applications this is important for otherwise the inconsistent view of the data could be confusing to the user.
Many developers have the incorrect perception that they do not need transactions if all they are doing is reading a database.
However, if you are doing multiple reads and you want them to be consistent, then you need to do them within a transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, even in the simplest of system, a single user environment where all operations are idempotent, retrying requires the capability to remember the list of participating resources as well as the operations that must be re-transmitted, potentially many times.
As we shall see, fortunately this is an inherent part of a transaction system, provided in a reliable manner such that it can tolerate its own failures as well as those that occur elsewhere within the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the Web and REST have progressed well without the need for transactions there are a class of applications where the use of transactions, or at least atomicity, would be beneficial.
To support this need, we have created a RESTful interface to the Narayana transaction manager.</p>
