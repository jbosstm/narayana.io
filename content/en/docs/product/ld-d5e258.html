                        As shown in Figure 1, whenever an application message is sent, the Client API automatically creates a context and
                        embeds it into the message. Similarly, any transaction-aware services are able to extract that
                        context using the service-side infrastructure and use it to perform work within the context of a
                        particular transaction â€“ even though that transaction was initiated elsewhere! The value of this
                        approach is that the business logic contained within the client application and services are not
                        peppered with transaction-processing code.
