<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>XML Transaction Service (XTS)</em> component of Narayana supports the coordination of private and public Web Services in a business transaction.
Therefore, to understand XTS, you must be familiar with Web Services, and also understand something about transactions.
This chapter introduces XTS and provides a brief overview of the technologies that form the Web Services standard.
Additionally, this chapter explores some of the fundamentals of transactioning technology and how it can be applied to Web Services.
Much of the content presented in this chapter is detailed throughout this guide.
However, only overview information about Web Services is provided.
If you are new to creating Web services, please consult your Web Services platform documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Narayana provides the XTS component as a transaction solution for Web Services.
Using XTS, business partners can coordinate complex business transactions in a controlled and reliable manner.
The XTS API supports a transactional coordination model based on the <em>WS-Coordination</em>, <em>WS-Atomic Transaction</em>, and <em>WS-Business Activity</em> specifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Protocols Included in XTS* WS-Coordination (WS-C) is a generic coordination framework developed by IBM, Microsoft and BEA.</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>WS-Atomic Transaction (WS-AT) and WS-Business Activity (WS-BA) together comprise the WS-Transaction (WS-T) transaction protocols that utilize this framework.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Narayana implements versions 1.1, and 1.2 of these three specifications.
Version specifications are available from <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/" class="bare">http://www.oasis-open.org/specs/</a> .</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Web Services</em> are modular, reusable software components that are created by exposing business functionality through a Web service interface.
Web Services communicate directly with other Web Services using standards-based technologies such as SOAP and HTTP.
These standards-based communication technologies enable customers, suppliers, and trading partners to access Web Services, independent of hardware operating system, or programming environment.
The result is a vastly improved collaboration environment as compared to today&#8217;s EDI and <em>business-to-business (B2B)</em> solutions, an environment where businesses can expose their current and future business applications as Web Services that can be easily discovered and accessed by external partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web Services, by themselves, are not fault-tolerant.
In fact, some of the reasons that the Web Services model is an attractive development solution are also the same reasons that service-based applications may have drawbacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Properties of Web Services</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Application components that are exposed as Web Services may be owned by third parties, which provides benefits in terms of cost of maintenance, but drawbacks in terms of having exclusive control over their behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web Services are usually remotely located, increasing risk of failure due to increased network travel for invocations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications that have high dependability requirements need a method of minimizing the effects of errors that may occur when an application consumes Web Services.
One method of safeguarding against such failures is to interact with an application&#8217;s Web Services within the context of a <em>transaction</em>.
A transaction is a unit of work which is completed entirely, or in the case of failures is reversed to some agreed consistent state.
The goal, in the event of a failure, is normally to appear as if the work had never occurred in the first place.
With XTS, transactions can span multiple Web Services, meaning that work performed across multiple enterprises can be managed with transactional support.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_managing_service_based_processes"><a class="anchor" href="#_managing_service_based_processes"></a>1.1. Managing service-Based Processes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XTS allows you to create transactions that drive complex business processes, spanning multiple Web Services.
Current Web Services standards do not address the requirements for a high-level coordination of services.
This is because in today&#8217;s Web Services applications, which use single request/response interactions, coordination is typically not a problem.
However, for applications that engage multiple services among multiple business partners, coordinating and controlling the resulting interactions is essential.
This becomes even more apparent when you realize that you generally have little in the way of formal guarantees when interacting with third-party Web Services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XTS provides the infrastructure for coordinating services during a business process.
By organizing processes as transactions, business partners can collaborate on complex business interactions in a reliable manner, insuring the integrity of their data - usually represented by multiple changes to a database – but without the usual overheads and drawbacks of directly exposing traditional transaction-processing engines directly onto the web.
<a href="#example_application">An Evening On the Town</a> demonstrates how an application may manage service-based processes as transactions:</p>
</div>
<div id="example_application" class="paragraph">
<div class="title">An Evening On the Town</div>
<p>The application in question allows a user to plan a social evening.
This application is responsible for reserving a table at a restaurant, and reserving tickets to a show.
Both activities are paid for using a credit card.
In this example, each service represents exposed Web Services provided by different service providers.
XTS is used to envelop the interactions between the theater and restaurant services into a single (potentially) long-running business transaction.
The business transaction must insure that seats are reserved both at the restaurant and the theater.
If one event fails the user has the ability to decline both events, thus returning both services back to their original state.
If both events are successful, the user&#8217;s credit card is charged and both seats are booked.
As you may expect, the interaction between the services must be controlled in a reliable manner over a period of time.
In addition, management must span several third-party services that are remotely deployed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without the backing of a transaction, an undesirable outcome may occur.
For example, the user credit card may be charged, even if one or both of the bookings fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#example_application">An Evening On the Town</a> describes the situations where XTS excels at supporting business processes across multiple enterprises.
This example is further refined throughout this guide, and appears as a standard demonstrator (including source code) with the XTS distribution.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_servlets"><a class="anchor" href="#_servlets"></a>1.2. Servlets</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WS-Coordination, WS-Atomic Transaction, and WS-Business Activity protocols are based on one-way interactions of entities rather than traditional synchronous request/response RPC-style interactions.
One group of entities, called transaction participants, invoke operations on other entities, such as the transaction coordinator, in order to return responses to requests.
The programming model is based on peer-to-peer relationships, with the result that all services, whether they are participants, coordinators or clients, must have an <em>active component</em> that allows them to receive unsolicited messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In XTS, the active component is achieved through deployment of JaxWS endpoints.
Each XTS endpoint that is reachable through SOAP/XML is published via JaxWS, without developer intevention.
The only requirement is that transactional client applications and transactional web services must reside within a domain capable of hosting JaxWS endpoints, such as an application server.
WildFly Application Server can provide this functionality.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_soap"><a class="anchor" href="#_soap"></a>1.3. SOAP</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>SOAP has emerged as the de facto message format for XML-based communication in the Web Services arena.
It is a lightweight protocol that allows the user to define the content of a message and to provide hints as to how recipients should process that message.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_web_services_description_language_wdsl"><a class="anchor" href="#_web_services_description_language_wdsl"></a>1.4. Web Services Description Language (WDSL)</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em class="term">Web Services Description Language (WSDL)</em> is an XML-based language used to define Web service interfaces.
An application that consumes a Web service parses the service&#8217;s WSDL document to discover the location of the service, the operations that the service supports, the protocol bindings the service supports (SOAP, HTTP, etc), and how to access them.
For each operation, WSDL describes the format that the client must follow.</p>

<h4 id="ref_createwsatclient"><a class="anchor" href="#ref_createwsatclient"></a>2.2.1. Creating Client Applications</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XTS integrates WS-AT transactions with JTA.
To invoke a web service inside a WS-AT transaction, simply start a new JTA transaction and invoke the web service.
By default, XTS will create a WS-AT context and pass it with your request.
See our quickstarts for an example: <a href="quickstarts_overview.html#ref_wsatmultiservice">WS-AT Multi-Service</a> and <a href="quickstarts_overview.html#ref_wsatmultihop">WS-AT Multi-Hop</a></p>

<h4 id="ref_createwsatservice"><a class="anchor" href="#ref_createwsatservice"></a>2.2.2. Creating Transactional Web Services</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly to the client-side, the service-side is also integrated with JTA.
To make your web service WS-AT compliant, annotate your web service class or method with the EJB 3 <code>jakarta.ejb.TransactionAttribute</code> annotation or the JTA <code>jakarta.transaction.Transactional annotation</code>.
XTS will automatically translate WS-AT context, received with the request, to JTA.
See our quickstarts for an example: <a href="quickstarts_overview.html#ref_wsatmultiservice">WS-AT Multi-Service</a> and <a href="quickstarts_overview.html#ref_wsatmultihop">WS-AT Multi-Hop</a></p>

Also JTA transactions are not always wanted in the application.
In such case it is possible to create client and service applications using the Raw XTS API.</p>

<p>There are two aspects to a client application using Raw XTS, the transaction declaration aspects, and the business logic.
The business logic includes the invocation of Web Services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transaction declaration aspects are handled automatically with the XTS client API.
This API provides simple transaction directives such as <code>begin</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>rollback</code>, which the client application can use to initialize, manage, and terminate transactions.
Internally, this API uses SOAP to invoke operations on the various WS-C and WS-AT services, in order to create a coordinator and drive the transaction to completion.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_user_transactions"><a class="anchor" href="#_user_transactions"></a>User Transactions</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A client uses the <code>UserTransactionFactory</code> and <code>UserTransaction</code> classes to create and manage WS-AT transactions.
These classes provide a simple API which operates in a manner similar to the JTA API.
A WS-AT transaction is started and associated with the client thread by calling the <code>begin</code> method of the <code>UserTransaction</code> class.
The transaction can be committed by calling the <code>commit</code> method, and rolled back by calling the <code>rollback</code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More complex transaction management, such as suspension and resumption of transactions, is supported by the <code>TransactionManagerFactory</code> and <code>TransactionManager</code> classes.</p>

<h5 id="ref_wsatrawcreatingtransactionalwebservices"><a class="anchor" href="#ref_wsatrawcreatingtransactionalwebservices"></a>Creating Transactional Web Services</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two parts to implementing a Web service using XTS are the transaction management and the business logic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bulk of the transaction management aspects are organized in a clear and easy-to-implement model by means of the XTS&#8217;s <em>Participant API</em>, provides a structured model for negotiation between the web service and the transaction coordinator.
It allows the web service to manage its own local transactional data, in accordance with the needs of the business logic, while ensuring that its activities are in step with those of the client and other services involved in the transaction.
Internally, this API uses SOAP to invokes operations on the various WS-C and WS-AT services, to drive the transaction to completion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>participant</em> is a software entity which is driven by the transaction manager on behalf of a Web service.
When a web service wants to participate in a particular transaction, it must enroll a participant to act as a proxy for the service in subsequent negotiations with the coordinator.
The participant implements an API appropriate to the type of transaction it is enrolled in, and the participant model selected when it is enrolled.
For example, a <code>Durable2PC</code> participant, as part of a WS-Atomic Transaction, implements the <code>Durable2PCParticipant</code> interface.
The use of participants allows the transactional control management aspects of the Web service to be factored into the participant implementation, while staying separate from the rest of the Web service&#8217;s business logic and private transactional data management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The creation of participants is not trivial, since they ultimately reflect the state of a Web service&#8217;s back-end processing facilities, an aspect normally associated with an enterprise&#8217;s own IT infrastructure.
Implementations must use one of the following interfaces: <code>com.arjuna.wst11.Durable2PCParticipant</code>, <code>com.arjuna.wst11.Volatile2PCParticipant</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A client creates and manages Business Activities using the <code>UserBusinessActivityFactory</code> and <code>UserBusinessActivity</code> classes.
A WS-BA activity is started and associated with the client thread by calling the <code>begin</code> method of the <code>UserBusinessActivity</code> class.
A client can terminate a business activity by calling the <code>close</code> method, and cancel it by calling the <code>cancel</code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If any of the Web Services invoked by the client register for the <code>BusinessActivityWithCoordinatorCompletion</code> protocol, the client can call the <code>completed</code> method before calling the <code>close</code> method, to notify the services that it has finished making service invocations in the current activity.</p>

<h3 id="ref_transactioncontextpropagation"><a class="anchor" href="#ref_transactioncontextpropagation"></a>2.4. Configuration of The Transaction Context Propagation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can enable transaction propagation for all Web service calls that are invoked within a JTA, WS-AT or WS-BA transaction.
This is done with the <code>default-context-propagation</code> property in the XTS subsystem config of the <code>standalone-xts.xml</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As this is enabled by default (for <code>standalone-xts.xml</code>), calls to all Web services that support WS-AT or WS-BA will automatically receive the transaction context allowing them to participate in the distributed transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transaction context is simply ignored if the service does not support WS-AT or WS-BA.
This is done by setting <code>MustUnderstand="false"</code> on the <code>CoordinationContext</code> SOAP header.
Unfortunately, this may cause issues when invoking WS-AT or WS-BA enabled Web services on other vendors' application servers.
This is because the WS-Coordination specification states that <code>MustUnderstand</code> must be set to true.
If you are affected by this issue, you will need to explicitly enable the transaction propagation for every port.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default context propagation policy can also be overridden on a per Web Service port basis.
This allows the developer to easily state which Web Service clients must and must-not propagate the transaction context.
This is done through the standard JAX-WS WebServiceFeature facility.
A JAX-WS <code>WebServiceFeature</code> allows meta-information to be added to a port that describe cross-cutting behaviour, such as logging, security or compression.
In our case we use the <a href="xts_api.html#ref_jtaoverwsatfeature">JTAOverWSATFeature</a> and <a href="xts_api.html#ref_wstxfeature">WSTXFeature</a> features.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="xts_api.html#ref_jtaoverwsatfeature">JTAOverWSATFeature</a> states that any JTA, WS-AT, or WS-BA transactions should be distributed via calls on this client.
This feature is recommended to use, if you have a JTA transactions which should be propagated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="xts_api.html#ref_wstxfeature">WSTXFeature</a> states that any WS-AT or WS-BA transaction should be distributed via calls on this client.
You should use this feature, if you use Raw XTS or WS-BA APIs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Calls to the service will fail if the Web service does not support WS-AT or WS-BA (in this case, XTS sets <code>MustUnderstand=true</code> on the <code>CoordinationContext</code> SOAP header as the developer has explicitly stated that it is required).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The developer may also state that the transaction must-not be distributed over calls to this Web service.
This is done by setting the <a href="xts_api.html#ref_jtaoverwsatfeature">JTAOverWSATFeature</a> or <a href="xts_api.html#ref_wstxfeature">WSTXFeature</a> feature to disabled.</p>

XTS provides header-processing infrastructure for use with Web Services transactions contexts for both client applications and Web Services.
XTS provides a simple interface for developing transaction participants, along with the necessary document-handling code.</p>

<h4 id="_overview"><a class="anchor" href="#_overview"></a>3.1.1. Overview</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>participant</code> is the entity that performs the work pertaining to transaction management on behalf of the business services involved in an application.
The Web service (in the example code, a theater booking system) contains some business logic to reserve a seat and inquire about availability, but it needs to be supported by something that maintains information in a durable manner.
Typically this is a database, but it could be a file system, NVRAM, or other storage mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the service may talk to the back-end database directly, it cannot commit or undo any changes, since committing and rolling back are ultimately under the control of a transaction.
For the transaction to exercise this control, it must communicate with the database.
In XTS, participant does this communication, as shown in <a href="#fig_participant_backend_control">Transactions, Participants, and Back-End Transaction Control</a>.</p>

<p>Implementing a participant is a relatively straightforward task.

<h5 id="_deploying_participants"><a class="anchor" href="#_deploying_participants"></a>Deploying Participants</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transactional web services and transactional clients are regular Jakarta EE applications and can be deployed into the application server in the same way as any other Jakarta EE application.
The XTS Subsystem exports all the client and web service API classes needed to manage transactions and enroll and manage participant web services.
It provides implementations of all the WS-C and WS-T coordination services, not just the coordinator services.
In particular, it exposes the client and web service participant endpoints which are needed to receive incoming messages originating from the coordinator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally, a transactional application client and the transaction web service it invokes will be deployed in different application servers.
As long as XTS is enabled on each of these containers it will transparently route coordination messages from clients or web services to their coordinator and vice versa.
When the client begins a transaction by default it creates a context using the coordination services in its local container.
The context holds a reference to the local Registration Service which means that any web services enlisted in the transaction enrol with the coordination services in the same container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coordinator does not need to reside in the same container as the client application.
By configuring the client deployment appropriately it is possible to use the coordinator services co-located with one of the web services or even to use services deployed in a separate, dedicated container.
See Chapter 8 Stand-Alone Coordination for details of how to configure a coordinator located in a different container to the client.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, coordination contexts are obtained from the local coordinator.
Therefore, WS-AT transactions or WS-BA activities created by a locally-deployed client application are supplied with a context which identifies the Registration Service running on the client&#8217;s machine.
Any Web Services invoked by the client are coordinated by the Transaction Protocol services running on the client&#8217;s host.
This is the case whether the Web Services are running locally or remotely.
Such a configuration is called <em>local coordination</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can reconfigure this setting globally for all clients, causing context creation requests to be redirected to an Activation Coordinator Service running on a remote host.
Normally, the rest of the coordination process is executed from the remote host.
This configuration is called <em>stand-alone coordination</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Reasons for Choosing a Stand-Alone Coordinator</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficiency: if a client application invokes Web Services on a remote WildFly Application Server, coordinating the transaction from the remote server might be more efficient, since the protocol-specific messages between the coordinator and the participants do not need to travel over the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliability: if the coordinator service runs on a dedicated host, there is no danger of failing applications or services affecting the coordinator and causing failures for unrelated transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A third reason might be to use a coordination service provided by a third party vendor.</p>

This is particularly useful for two specific use cases.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The first case is where the client is expected to use an XTS coordinator deployed in another WildFly Application Server.
If, for example, this WildFly Application Server is bound to address <code>10.0.1.99</code> , setting property <code>coordinator.address</code> to <code>10.0.1.99</code> is normally all that is required to configure the coordinator URL to identity the remote WildFly Application Server&#8217;s coordination service.
If the Web service on the remote WildFly Application Server were reset to <code>9090</code> then it would also be necessary to set property <code>coordinator.port</code> to this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second common use case is where communications between client and coordinator, and between participant and coordinator, must use secure connections.
If property <code>coordinator.scheme</code> is set to value <code>https</code>, the client&#8217;s request to begin a transaction is sent to the coordinator service over a secure https connection.
The XTS coordinator and participant services will ensure that all subsequent communications between coordinator and client or coordinator and web services also employ secure https connections.
Note that this requires configuring the trust stores in the WildFly Application Server running the client, coordinator and participant web services with appropriate trust certificates.</p>

<h2 id="_participant_crash_recovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_participant_crash_recovery"></a>5. Participant Crash Recovery</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A key requirement of a transaction service is to be resilient to a system crash by a host running a participant, as well as the host running the transaction coordination services.
Crashes which happen before a transaction terminates or before a business activity completes are relatively easy to accommodate.
The transaction service and participants can adopt a <code>presumed abort</code> policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<div class="title">Procedure: Presumed Abort Policy</div>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If the coordinator crashes, it can assume that any transaction it does not know about is invalid, and reject a participant request which refers to such a transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the participant crashes, it can forget any provisional changes it has made, and reject any request from the coordinator service to prepare a transaction or complete a business activity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Crash recovery is more complex if the crash happens during a transaction commit operation, or between completing and closing a business activity.
The transaction service must ensure as far as possible that participants arrive at a consistent outcome for the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">WS-AT Transaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>The transaction needs to commit all provisional changes or roll them all back to the state before the transaction started.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WS-Business Activity Transaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>All participants need to close the activity or cancel the activity, and run any required compensating actions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the rare occasions where such a consensus cannot be reached, the transaction service must log and report transaction failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XTS includes support for automatic recovery of WS-AT and WS-BA transactions, if either or both of the coordinator and participant hosts crashes.
The XTS recovery manager begins execution on coordinator and participant hosts when the XTS service restarts.
On a coordinator host, the recovery manager detects any WS-AT transactions which have prepared but not committed, as well as any WS-BA transactions which have completed but not yet closed.
It ensures that all their participants are rolled forward in the first case, or closed in the second.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On a participant host, the recovery manager detects any prepared WS-AT participants which have not responded to a transaction rollback, and any completed WS-BA participants which have not yet responded to an activity cancel request, and ensures that the former are rolled back and the latter are compensated.
The recovery service also allows for recovery of subordinate WS-AT transactions and their participants if a crash occurs on a host where an interposed WS-AT coordinator has been employed.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">

<h4 id="_ws_at_coordinator_crash_recovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_ws_at_coordinator_crash_recovery"></a>5.1.1. WS-AT Coordinator Crash Recovery</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WS-AT coordination service tracks the status of each participant in a transaction as the transaction progresses through its two-phase commit.
When all participants have been sent a <code>prepare</code> message and have responded with a <code>prepared</code> message, the coordinator writes a log record storing each participant&#8217;s details, indicating that the transaction is ready to complete.
If the coordinator service crashes after this point has been reached, completion of the two-phase commit protocol is still guaranteed, by reading the log file after reboot and sending a <code>commit</code> message to each participant.
Once all participants have responded to the <code>commit</code> with a <code>committed</code> message, the coordinator can safely delete the log entry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the <code>prepared</code> messages returned by the participants imply that they are ready to commit their provisional changes and make them permanent, this type of recovery is safe.
Additionally, the coordinator does not need to account for any commit messages which may have been sent before the crash, or resend messages if it crashes several times.
The XTS participant implementation is resilient to redelivery of the <code>commit</code> messages.
If the participant has implemented the recovery functions described in <a href="#ws_at_recovery_api">WS-AT Participant Crash Recovery APIs</a>, the coordinator can guarantee delivery of <code>commit</code> messages if both it crashes, and one or more of the participant service hosts also crash, at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the coordination service crashes before the <code>prepare</code> phase completes, the presumed abort protocol ensures that participants are rolled back.
After system restart, the coordination service has the information about about all the transactions which could have entered the <code>commit</code> phase before the reboot, since they have entries in the log.
It also knows about any active transactions started after the reboot.
If a participant is waiting for a response, after sending its <code>prepared</code> message, it automatically re-sends the <code>prepared</code> message at regular intervals.
When the coordinator detects a transaction which is not active and has no entry in the log file after the reboot, it instructs the participant to abort, ensuring that the web service gets a chance to roll back any provisional state changes it made on behalf of the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A web service may decide to unilaterally commit or roll back provisional changes associated with a given participant, if configured to time-out after a specified length of time without a response.
In this situation, the the web service should record this action and log a message to persistent storage.
When the participant receives a request to commit or roll back, it should throw an exception if its unilateral decision action does not match the requested action.
The coordinator detects the exception and logs a message marking the outcome as heuristic.
It also saves the state of the transaction permanently in the transaction log, to be inspected and reconciled by an administrator.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>WS-AT participants associated with a transactional web service do not need to be involved in crash recovery if the Web service&#8217;s host machine crashes before the participant is told to prepare.
The coordinator will assume that the transaction has aborted, and the Web service can discard any information associated with unprepared transactions when it reboots.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a participant is told to <code>prepare</code>, the Web service is expected to save to persistent storage the transactional state it needs to commit or roll back the transaction.
The specific information it needs to save is dependent on the implementation and business logic of the Web Service.
However, the participant must save this state before returning a <code>prepared</code> vote from the <code>prepare</code> call.
If the participant cannot save the required state, or there is some other problem servicing the request made by the client, it must return an <code>aborted</code> vote.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The XTS participant services running on a Web Service&#8217;s host machine cooperate with the Web service implementation to facilitate participant crash recovery.
These participant services are responsible for calling the participant&#8217;s <code>prepare</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>rollback</code> methods.
The XTS implementation tracks the local state of every enlisted participant.
If the <code>prepare</code> call returns a <code>prepared</code> vote, the XTS implementation ensures that the participant state is logged to the local transaction log before forwarding a <code>prepared</code> message to the coordinator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A participant log record contains information identifying the participant, its transaction, and its coordinator.
This is enough information to allow the rebooted XTS implementation to reinstate the participant as active and to continue communication with the coordinator, as though the participant had been enlisted and driven to the prepared state.
However, a participant instance is still necessary for the commit or rollback process to continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Full recovery requires the log record to contain information needed by the Web service which enlisted the participant.
This information must allow it to recreate an equivalent participant instance, which can continue the <code>commit</code> process to completion, or roll it back if some other Web Service fails to <code>prepare</code> . This information might be as simple as a String key which the participant can use to locate the data it made persistent before returning its Prepared vote.
It may be as complex as a serialized object tree containing the original participant instance and other objects created by the Web service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a participant instance implements the relevant interface, the XTS implementation will append this participant recovery state to its log record before writing it to persistent storage.
In the event of a crash, the participant recovery state is retrieved from the log and passed to the Web Service which created it.
The Web Service uses this state to create a new participant, which the XTS implementation uses to drive the transaction to completion.
Log records are only deleted after the participant&#8217;s <code>commit</code> or <code>rollback</code> method is called.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a Business Activity participant web service completes its work, it may want to save the information which will be required later to close or compensate actions performed during the activity.
The XTS implementation automatically acquires this information from the participant as part of the completion process and writes it to a participant log record.
This ensures that the information can be restored and used to recreate a copy of the participant even if the web service container crashes between the complete and close or compensate operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a Participant Completion participant, this information is acquired when the web service invokes the <code>completed</code> method of the <code>BAParticipantManager</code> instance returned from the call which enlisted the participant.
For a Coordinator Completion participant this occurs immediately after the call to it&#8217;s <code>completed</code> method returns.
This assumes that the <code>completed</code> method does not throw an exception or call the participant manager&#8217;s <code>cannotComplete</code> or <code>fail</code> method.</p>

The participant identifier, which is supplied as argument to the <code>deserialize</code> or <code>recreate</code> method, is the identifier used by the Web service when the original participant was enlisted in the transaction.
Web Services participating in recovery processing should ensure that participant identifiers are unique per service.

A transition point occurs during closure, once all <code>CoordinatorCompletion</code> participants receive a <code>complete</code> message and respond with a <code>completed</code> message.
At this point, all <code>ParticipantCompletion</code> participants should have sent a <code>completed</code> message.
The coordinator writes a log record storing the details of each participant, and indicating that the transaction is ready to close.

If the participant was created by some other Web service, the module should return <code>null</code>.
The participant identifier supplied as an argument to the <code>deserialize</code> or <code>recreate</code> calls is the identifier used by the Web service when the original participant was enlisted in the transaction.
Web Services which participate in recovery processing should ensure that the participant identifiers they employ are unique per service.
If a module recognizes a participant identifier as belonging to its Web service, but cannot recreate the participant, it throws an exception.
This situation might arise if the service cannot associate the participant with any transactional information specific to business logic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A module must be registered by the application, even when it relies upon serialization to create the participant recovery state saved by the XTS implementation.
The <code>deserialization</code> operation must employ a class loader capable of loading Web service-specific classes.
The XTS implementation achieves this by delegating responsibility for the <code>deserialize</code> operation to the recovery module.</p>

<h5 id="_securing_web_service_state_changes"><a class="anchor" href="#_securing_web_service_state_changes"></a>Securing Web Service State Changes</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a BA participant completes, it is expected to commit changes to the web service state made during the activity.
The web service usually also needs to persist these changes to a local storage device.
This leaves open a window where the persisted changes may not be guarded with the necessary compensation information.
The web service container may crash after the changes to the service state have been written but before the XTS implementation is able to acquire the recovery state and write a recovery log record for the participant.
Participants may close this window by employing a two phase update to the local store used to persist the web service state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A participant which needs to persist changes to local web service state should implement interface <code>ConfirmCompletedParticipant</code> in package <code>com.arjuna.wst11</code>.
This signals to the XTS implementation that it expects confirmation after a successful write of the participant recovery record, allowing it to roll forward provisionally persisted changes to the web service state.
Delivery of this confirmation can be guaranteed even if the web service container crashes after writing the participant log record.
Conversely, if a recovery record cannot be written because of a fault or a crash prior to writing, the provisional changes can be guaranteed to be rolled back.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the participant is ready to complete, it should prepare its persistent changes by temporarily locking access to the relevant state in the local store and writing the changed data to disk, retaining both the old and new versions of the service state.
For a Participant Completion participant, this prepare operation should be done just before calling the participant manager&#8217;s <code>completed</code> method.
For a Coordinator Completion participant, it should be done just before returning from the call to the participant&#8217;s <code>completed</code> method.
After writing the participant log record, the XTS implementation calls the participant&#8217;s <code>confirmCompleted</code> method, providing value <code>true</code> as the argument.
The participant should respond by installing the provisional state changes and releasing any locks.
If the log record cannot be written, the XTS implementation calls the participant&#8217;s <code>confirmCompleted</code> method, providing value <code>false</code> as the argument.
The participant should respond by restoring the original state values and releasing any locks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a crash occurs before the call to <code>confirmCompleted</code>, the application&#8217;s recovery module can make sure that the provisional changes to the web service state are rolled forward or rolled back as appropriate.
The web service must identify all provisional writes to persistent state before it starts serving new requests or processing recovered participants.
It must reobtain any locks required to ensure that the state is not changed by new transactions.
When the recovery module recovers a participant from the log, its compensation information is available.
If the participant still has prepared changes, the recovery code must call <code>confirmCompleted</code>, passing value true.
This allows the participant to finish the <code>complete</code> operation.
The XTS implementation then forwards a <code>completed</code> message to the coordinator, ensuring that the participant is subsequently notified either to close or to compensate.
At the end of the first recovery scan, the recovery module may find some prepared changes on disk which are still unaccounted for.
This means that the participant recovery record is not available.
The recovery module should restore the original state values and release any locks.
The XTS implementation responds to coordinator requests regarding the participant with an <code>unknown participant</code> fault, forcing the activity as a whole to be rolled back.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic building blocks of a transactional Web Services application include the application itself, the Web services that the application consumes, the Transaction Manager, and the transaction participants which support those Web services.
Although it is likely that different developers will be responsible for each piece, the concepts are presented here so that you can see the whole picture.
Often, developers produce services, or applications that consume services, and system administrators run the transaction-management infrastructure.</p>

<p>The transaction manager is a Web service which coordinates XTS transactions.
It is the only software component in XTS that is designed to be run directly as a network service, rather than to support end-user code.
The transaction manager runs as a JAXM request/response Web service.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This quickstart uses JTA to manage WS-AT applications.
The quickstart is composed of a client (the test) and two Web services (<code>FirstServiceAT</code> and <code>SecondServiceAT</code>).
Both services are invoked by the test from within the same JTA transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Client begins a JTA transaction and then invokes an operation on each service.
Transaction context propagation is enabled by default.
Therefore XTS automatically bridges the JTA transaction to a WS-AT transaction before each invocation is made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each service uses JPA to persist its data (the value of a counter).
Therefore, the service class is annotated with <code>jakarta.ejb.TransactionAttribute</code> which tells XTS to automatically bridge WS-AT transaction to JTA.</p>
