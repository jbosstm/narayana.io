<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Transactions Overview Guide contains information on how to use Narayana;
to develop applications that use transaction technology to manage business processes.
This document covers functionality that is available within both the Narayana community version and
is also available within the Red Hat JBoss EAP product.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_document_conventions"><a class="anchor" href="#_document_conventions"></a>Document Conventions</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This manual uses several conventions to highlight certain words and phrases and draw attention to specific pieces of information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In PDF and paper editions, this manual uses typefaces drawn from the <a href="https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/">Liberation Fonts</a> set.
The Liberation Fonts set is also used in HTML editions if the set is installed on your system.
If not, alternative but equivalent typefaces are displayed.
Note: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5 and later includes the Liberation Fonts set by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_typographic_conventions"><a class="anchor" href="#_typographic_conventions"></a>Typographic Conventions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Four typographic conventions are used to call attention to specific words and phrases.
These conventions, and the circumstances they apply to, are as follows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Mono-spaced Bold</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Used to highlight system input, including shell commands, file names and paths.
Also used to highlight keycaps and key combinations.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see the contents of the file <em>my_next_bestselling_novel</em> in your current working directory, enter the <code>cat my_next_bestselling_novel</code> command at the shell prompt and press <code>Enter</code> to execute the command.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above includes a file name, a shell command and a keycap, all presented in mono-spaced bold and all distinguishable thanks to context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Key combinations can be distinguished from keycaps by the hyphen connecting each part of a key combination.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="shell">Press `Enter` to execute the command.

Press
// &lt;keycombo&gt;
//   &lt;keycap&gt;Ctrl&lt;/keycap&gt;
//   &lt;keycap&gt;Alt&lt;/keycap&gt;
//   &lt;keycap&gt;F2&lt;/keycap&gt;
// &lt;/keycombo&gt;
 to switch to the first virtual terminal.
Press
// &lt;keycombo&gt;
//   &lt;keycap&gt;Ctrl&lt;/keycap&gt;
//   &lt;keycap&gt;Alt&lt;/keycap&gt;
//   &lt;keycap&gt;F1&lt;/keycap&gt;
// &lt;/keycombo&gt;
 to return to your X-Windows session.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first paragraph highlights the particular keycap to press.
The second highlights two key combinations (each a set of three keycaps with each set pressed simultaneously).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If source code is discussed, class names, methods, functions, variable names and returned values mentioned within a paragraph will be presented as above, in <code>mono-spaced bold</code>.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>File-related classes include <code>filesystem</code> for file systems, <code>file</code> for files, and <code>dir</code> for directories.
Each class has its own associated set of permissions.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Proportional Bold</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This denotes words or phrases encountered on a system, including application names; dialog box text; labeled buttons; check-box and radio button labels; menu titles and sub-menu titles.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choose <code>Preferences &gt; Mouse</code> from the main menu bar to launch <code>Mouse Preferences</code>.
In the <code>Buttons tab</code>, click the <code>Left-handed mouse</code> check box and click <code>Close</code> to switch the primary mouse button from the left to the right (making the mouse suitable for use in the left hand).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To insert a special character into a <code>gedit</code> file, choose <code>Accessories &gt; Character Map</code> from the main menu bar.
Next, choose <code>Find</code> from the <code>Character Map</code> menu bar, type the name of the character in the <code>Search</code> field and click <code>Next</code>.
The character you sought will be highlighted in the <code>Character Table</code>.
Double-click this highlighted character to place it in the <code>Text to copy</code> field and then click the <code>Copy</code> button.
Now switch back to your document and choose <code>Paste</code> from the <code>gedit</code> menu bar.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above text includes application names; system-wide menu names and items; application-specific menu names; and buttons and text found within a GUI interface, all presented in proportional bold and all distinguishable by context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>Mono-spaced Bold Italic</code> or <code>Proportional Bold Italic</code></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whether mono-spaced bold or proportional bold, the addition of italics indicates replaceable or variable text.
Italics denotes text you do not input literally or displayed text that changes depending on circumstance.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To connect to a remote machine using ssh, type <code>ssh <a href="mailto:username@domain.name">username@domain.name</a></code> at a shell prompt.
If the remote machine is <em>example.com</em> and your username on that machine is john, type <code>ssh <a href="mailto:john@example.com">john@example.com</a></code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>mount -o remount file-system</code> command remounts the named file system.
For example, to remount the <code>/home file system</code>, the command is <code>mount -o remount /home</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see the version of a currently installed package, use the <code>rpm -q package</code> command.
It will return a result as follows: <code>package-version-release</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the words in bold italics above -username, domain.name, file-system, package, version and release.
Each word is a placeholder, either for text you enter when issuing a command or for text displayed by the system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aside from standard usage for presenting the title of a work, italics denotes the first use of a new and important term.
For example:</p>
</div>
<div class="exampleblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This documentation uses <em>Asciidoc</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pull_quote_conventions"><a class="anchor" href="#_pull_quote_conventions"></a>Pull-quote Conventions</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Terminal output and source code listings are set off visually from the surrounding text.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Output sent to a terminal is set in <code>mono-spaced roman</code> and presented thus:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>books        Desktop   documentation  drafts  mss    photos   stuff  svn
books_tests  Desktop1  downloads      images  notes  scripts  svgs</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Source-code listings are also set in <code>mono-spaced roman</code> but add syntax highlighting as follows:</p>

<p>This chapter deals with the theory of transactional services.
If you are familiar with these principles, consider this chapter a reference.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider the following situation: a user wishes to purchase access to an on-line newspaper and requires to pay for this access from an account maintained by an on-line bank.
Once the newspaper site has received the user&#8217;s credit from the bank, they will deliver an electronic token to the user granting access to their site.
Ideally the user would like the debiting of the account, and delivery of the token to be "all or nothing" (atomic).
However, hardware and software failures could prevent either event from occurring, and leave the system in an indeterminate state.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Atomic transactions (transactions) possess an "all-or-nothing" property, and are a well-known technique for guaranteeing application consistency in the presence of failures.
Transactions possess the following ACID properties:</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Atomicity: The transaction completes successfully (commits) or if it fails (aborts) all of its effects are undone (rolled back).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Consistency: Transactions produce consistent results and preserve application specific invariants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Isolation: Intermediate states produced while a transaction is executing are not visible to others.
Furthermore transactions appear to execute serially, even if they are actually executed concurrently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Durability: The effects of a committed transaction are never lost (except by a catastrophic failure).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A transaction can be terminated in two ways: committed or aborted (rolled back).
When a transaction is committed, all changes made within it are made durable (forced on to stable storage, e.g., disk).
When a transaction is aborted, all of the changes are undone.
Atomic actions can also be nested; the effects of a nested action are provisional upon the <code>commit</code>/<code>abort</code> of the outermost (top-level) atomic action.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transactions have emerged as the dominant paradigm for coordinating interactions between parties in a (distributed) system, and in particular to manage applications that require concurrent access to shared data.
A classic transaction is a unit of work that either completely succeeds, or fails with all partially completed work being undone.
When a transaction is committed, all changes made by the associated requests are made durable, normally by committing the results of the work to a database.
If a transaction should fail and is rolled back, all changes made by the associated work are undone.
Transactions in distributed systems typically require the use of a transaction manager that is responsible for coordinating all of the participants that are part of the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">The main components involved in using and defining transactional applications are:</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A Transaction Service: The Transaction Service captures the model of the underlying transaction protocol and coordinates parties affiliated with the transaction according to that model.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Transaction API: Provides an interface for transaction demarcation and the registration of participants.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A Participant: The entity that cooperates with the transaction service on behalf of its associated business logic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Context: Captures the necessary details of the transaction such that participants can enlist within its scope.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_coordinator"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_coordinator"></a>1.2. The Coordinator</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Associated with every transaction is a coordinator, which is responsible for governing the outcome of the transaction.
The coordinator may be implemented as a separate service or may be co-located with the user for improved performance.
Each coordinator is created by the transaction manager service, which is in effect a factory for those coordinators.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A coordinator communicates with enrolled participants to inform them of the desired termination requirements, i.e., whether they should accept (e.g., confirm) or reject (e.g., cancel) the work done within the scope of the given transaction.
For example, whether to purchase the (provisionally reserved) flight tickets for the user or to release them.
An application/client may wish to terminate a transaction in a number of different ways (e.g., confirm or cancel).
However, although the coordinator will attempt to terminate in a manner consistent with that desired by the client, it is ultimately the interactions between the coordinator and the participants that will determine the actual final outcome.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A transaction manager is typically responsible for managing coordinators for many transactions.
The initiator of the transaction (e.g., the client) communicates with a transaction manager and asks it to start a new transaction and associate a coordinator with the transaction.
Once created, the context can be propagated to Web services in order for them to associate their work with the transaction.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coordinator cannot know the details of how every transactional service is implemented; in fact it is not necessary for it to do so in order to negotiate a transactional outcome.
It treats each service taking part in a transaction as a participant and communicates with it according to some predefined participant coordination models appropriate to the type of transaction.
When a service begins performing work within the scope of a transaction it enrolls itself with the coordinator as a participant, specifying the participant model it wishes to follow.
So, the term participant merely refers a transactional service enrolled in a specific transaction using a specific participant model.</p>

<h3 id="_commit_protocol"><a class="anchor" href="#_commit_protocol"></a>1.5. Commit protocol</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A two-phase commit protocol is required to guarantee that all of the action participants either <code>commit</code> or <code>abort</code> any changes made.
See <a href="#two_phase_commit_overview">Two-Phase <code>Commit</code> Overview</a> which illustrates the main aspects of the commit protocol: during phase 1, the action coordinator, C, attempts to communicate with all of the action participants, A and B, to determine whether they will <code>commit</code> or <code>abort</code>.
An <code>abort</code> reply from any participant acts as a veto, causing the entire action to <code>abort</code>.
Based upon these (lack of) responses, the coordinator arrives at the decision of whether to <code>commit</code> or <code>abort</code> the action.
If the action will <code>commit</code>, the coordinator records this decision on stable storage, and the protocol enters phase 2, where the coordinator forces the participants to carry out the decision.
The coordinator also informs the participants if the action aborts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When each participant receives the coordinator&#8217;s phase 1 message, they record sufficient information on stable storage to either <code>commit</code> or <code>abort</code> changes made during the action.
After returning the phase 1 response, each participant who returned a <code>commit</code> response must remain blocked until it has received the coordinator&#8217;s phase 2 message.
Until they receive this message, these resources are unavailable for use by other actions.
If the coordinator fails before delivery of this message, these resources remain blocked.
However, if crashed machines eventually recover, crash recovery mechanisms can be employed to unblock the protocol and terminate the action.</p>

<h3 id="_the_synchronization_protocol"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_synchronization_protocol"></a>1.6. The Synchronization Protocol</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Besides the two-phase commit protocol, traditional transaction processing systems employ an additional protocol, often referred to as the <em>synchronization protocol</em>.
With the original ACID properties, Durability is important when state changes need to be available despite failures.
Applications interact with a persistence store of some kind, such as a database, and this interaction can impose a significant overhead, because disk access is much slower to access than main computer memory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One solution to the problem disk access time is to cache the state in main memory and only operate on the cache for the duration of a transaction.
Unfortunately, this solution needs a way to flush the state back to the persistent store before the transaction terminates, or risk losing the full ACID properties.
This is what the synchronization protocol does, with <em>Synchronization Participants</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Synchronizations are informed that a transaction is about to <code>commit</code>.
At that point, they can flush cached state, which might be used to improve performance of an application, to a durable representation prior to the transaction committing.
The synchronizations are then informed about when the transaction completes and its completion state.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Procedure: The "Four Phase Protocol" Created By Synchronizations</div>
<p>Synchronizations essentially turn the two-phase commit protocol into a four-phase protocol:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Step 1</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before the transaction starts the two-phase commit, all registered Synchronizations are informed.
Any failure at this point will cause the transaction to <code>roll back</code>.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 2 and 3</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coordinator then conducts the normal two-phase commit protocol.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Step 4</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the transaction has terminated, all registered Synchronizations are informed.
However, this is a courtesy invocation because any failures at this stage are ignored: the transaction has terminated so there&#8217;s nothing to affect.</p>
</div>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The synchronization protocol does not have the same failure requirements as the traditional two-phase commit protocol.
For example, Synchronization participants do not need the ability to recover in the event of failures, because any failure before the two-phase commit protocol completes cause the transaction to <code>roll back</code>, and failures after it completes have no effect on the data which the Synchronization participants are responsible for.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to guarantee atomicity, the two-phase commit protocol is <code>blocking</code>.
As a result of failures, participants may remain blocked for an indefinite period of time, even if failure recovery mechanisms exist.
Some applications and participants cannot tolerate this blocking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To break this blocking nature, participants that are past the <code>prepare</code> phase are allowed to make autonomous decisions about whether to <code>commit</code> or <code>rollback</code>.
Such a participant must record its decision, so that it can complete the original transaction if it eventually gets a request to do so.
If the coordinator eventually informs the participant of the transaction outcome, and it is the same as the choice the participant made, no conflict exists.
If the decisions of the participant and coordinator are different, the situation is referred to as a non-atomic outcome, and more specifically as a <em>heuristic outcome</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Resolving and reporting heuristic outcomes to the application is usually the domain of complex, manually driven system administration tools, because attempting an automatic resolution requires semantic information about the nature of participants involved in the transactions.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Precisely when a participant makes a heuristic decision depends on the specific implementation.
Likewise, the choice the participant makes about whether to <code>commit</code> or to <code>roll back</code> depends upon the implementation, and possibly the application and the environment in which it finds itself.

<h3 id="_interposition"><a class="anchor" href="#_interposition"></a>1.9. Interposition</h3>

<p>Interposition is particularly useful for Web Services transactions, as a way of limiting the amount of network traffic required for coordination.
For example, if communications between the top-level coordinator and a web service are slow because of network traffic or distance, the web service might benefit from executing in a subordinate transaction which employs a local coordinator service.
In <a href="#fig_interpositions">Interpositions</a> ,to <code>prepare</code>, the top-level coordinator only needs to send one <code>prepare</code> message to the subordinate coordinator, and receive one <code>prepared</code> or <code>aborted</code> reply.
The subordinate coordinator forwards a <code>prepare</code> locally to each participant and combines the results to decide whether to send a single <code>prepared</code> or <code>aborted</code> reply.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many component technologies offer mechanisms for coordinating ACID transactions based on two-phase <code>commit</code> semantics.
Some of these are CORBA/OTS, JTS/JTA, and MTS/MSDTC.
ACID transactions are not suitable for all Web Services transactions, as explained in <a href="#acid_not_suitable">Reasons ACID is Not Suitable for Web Services</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="acid_not_suitable" class="ulist">
<div class="title">Reasons ACID is Not Suitable for Web Services</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Classic ACID transactions assume that an organization that develops and deploys applications owns the entire infrastructure for the applications.
This infrastructure has traditionally taken the form of an Intranet.
Ownership implies that transactions operate in a trusted and predictable manner.
To assure ACIDity, potentially long-lived locks can be kept on underlying data structures during two-phase <code>commit</code>.
Resources can be used for any period of time and released when the transaction is complete.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Web Services, these assumptions are no longer valid.
One obvious reason is that the owners of data exposed through a Web service refuse to allow their data to be locked for extended periods, since allowing such locks invites denial-of-service attacks.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>All application infrastructures are generally owned by a single party.
Systems using classical ACID transactions normally assume that participants in a transaction will obey the directives of the transaction manager and only infrequently make unilateral decisions which harm other participants in a transaction.</p>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web Services participating in a transaction can effectively decide to resign from the transaction at any time, and the consumer of the service generally has little in the way of quality of service guarantees to prevent this.</p>

<p>The Recovery Manager is a daemon process responsible for performing crash recovery.
Only one Recovery Manager runs per node.
The Object Store provides persistent data storage for transactions to log data.
During normal transaction processing each transaction will log persistent data needed for the commit phase to the Object Store.
On successfully committing a transaction this data is removed, however if the transaction fails then this data remains within the Object Store.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Recovery Manager functions by:</p>

<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>Periodically scanning the Object Store for transactions that may have failed.

<p>On initialisation, the Recovery Manager first loads in configuration information via a properties file.
This configuration includes a number of recovery activators and recovery modules, which are then dynamically loaded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Recovery Manager is not specifically tied to an Object Request Broker or ORB.
Hence, the OTS recovery protocol is not implicitly enabled.
To enable such protocol, we use the concept of recovery activator, defined with the interface <code>RecoveryActivator</code>, which is used to instantiate a recovery class related to the underlying communication protocol.
For instance, when used with OTS, the <code>RecoveryActivitor</code> has the responsibility to create a <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object able to respond to the <code>replay_completion</code> operation.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each recovery module is used to recover a different type of transaction/resource, however each recovery module inherits the same basic behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Recovery consists of two separate passes/phases separated by two timeout periods.
The first pass examines the object store for potentially failed transactions; the second pass performs crash recovery on failed transactions.
The timeout between the first and second pass is known as the backoff period.
The timeout between the end of the second pass and the start of the first pass is the recovery period.
The recovery period is larger than the backoff period.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Recovery Manager invokes the first pass upon each recovery module, applies the backoff period timeout, invokes the second pass upon each recovery module and finally applies the recovery period timeout before restarting the first pass again.</p>

Conversely, due to specific configurations it may be that multiple Recovery Managers share the same Object Store and in which case should not conflict with each other, e.g., roll back transactions that they do not understand.
Therefore, when running recovery it is necessary to tell Narayana which types of transactions it can recover and which transaction identifiers it should ignore.</p>

<p>When necessary each transaction identifier that Narayana creates may have a unique node identifier encoded within it and Narayana will only recover transactions and states that match a specified node identifier.

<p>After failure it is sometimes desirable to recover on a different node from the one where the transaction manager failed.
This kind of usage is only supported in JTA mode running inside an application server (with certain restrictions) and is not typical because of the consequences of incorrect configuration:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Only JTA transactions will be recovered (so the failing node must be configured in JTA mode).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing versions of Narayana or the application server on the new node is not supported.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The recovering node must have access to the same object store logs as the failed node (which can be achieved by either copying the logs or by using a shared file system or by using the JDBC object store connected to a database that is accessible to both nodes).
If you are using the JDBC object store ensure that it is configured the same way on both nodes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Both nodes must have access to the same set of resource managers and with the same configuration (minimally, the JNDI names must not change).
Often the deployment model for databases is to host the resource manager on a different node from the application server so generally this should not be an issue.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Recovery requires help from Resource Managers which should be configured to support the ability to recover from other nodes.
Database recovery is known to work but other resource managers may require case by case consideration.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If application deployments define their own datasources then these applications must also be deployed on the new server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is recommended that the transaction subsystem is configured in the same way on the new node as it was on the failed one.
In particular the node identifier should not change.
The comment made in the previous section about the uniqueness of the node identifier still applies so it is imperative that the failed node is not brought back online without changing its configuration.
The same restrictions regarding object stores still apply, namely "exactly one recovery manager per <code>ObjectStore</code> must run on each node and ObjectStores must not be shared by multiple nodes".</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before restarting recovery on the new node sanity check your configuration to ensure it does not contain any hard coded IP addresses that refer to network interfaces on the failed node.</p>

<p>This is a long list of caveats and if it is not possible to simply restart the failed node then, in order to avoid the consequences of incorrect configuration, we advise that the application server on the recovering node uses the same configuration file as the failed node.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>During recovery, the Transaction Manager needs to be able to communicate to all resource managers that are in use by the applications in the system.
For each resource manager, the Transaction Manager uses the <code>XAResource.recover</code> method to retrieve the list of transactions that are currently in a prepared or heuristically completed state.
Typically, the system administrator configures all transactional resource factories that are used by the applications deployed on the system.
An example of such a resource factory is the <code>JDBC XADataSource</code> object, which is a factory for the <code>JDBC XAConnection</code> objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because <code>XAResource</code> objects are not persistent across system failures, the Transaction Manager needs to have some way to acquire the <code>XAResource</code> objects that represent the resource managers which might have participated in the transactions prior to the system failure.
For example, a Transaction Manager might, through the use of JNDI lookup mechanism, acquire a connection from each of the transactional resource factories, and then obtain the corresponding <code>XAResource</code> object for each connection.
The Transaction Manager then invokes the <code>XAResource.recover</code> method to ask each resource manager to return the transactions that are currently in a prepared or heuristically completed state.</p>

<p>Its behavior consists of two aspects: "transaction-initiated" and "`esource-initiated" recovery.
Transaction-initiated recovery is possible where the particular transaction branch had progressed far enough for a JTA Resource Record to be written in the <code>ObjectStore</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A JTA Resource record contains the information needed to link the transaction, as known to the rest of Narayana, to the database.
Resource-initiated recovery is necessary for branches where a failure occurred after the database had made a persistent record of the transaction, but before the JTA <code>ResourceRecord</code> was persisted.
Resource-initiated recovery is also necessary for datasources for which it is not possible to hold information in the JTA Resource record that allows the recreation in the <code>RecoveryManager</code> of the <code>XAConnection</code>/<code>XAResource</code> that was used in the original application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transaction-initiated recovery is automatic.
The <code>XARecoveryModule</code> finds the JTA Resource Record that need recovery, then uses the normal recovery mechanisms to find the status of the transaction it was involved in (i.e., it calls replay_completion on the RecoveryCoordinator for the transaction branch), (re)creates the appropriate <code>XAResource</code> and issues commit or rollback on it as appropriate.
The <code>XAResource</code> creation will use the same information, database name, username, password etc., as the original application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Resource-initiated recovery has to be specifically configured, by supplying the Recovery Manager with the appropriate information for it to interrogate all the databases (<code>XADataSources</code>) that have been accessed by any Narayana application.
The access to each XADataSource is handled by a class that implements the <code>com.arjuna.ats.jta.recovery.XAResourceRecovery</code> interface, as illustrated in <a href="#resource-initiated_recovery_and_XA_recovery">Resource-initiated recovery and XA Recovery</a>.
Instances of classes that implements the <code>XAResourceRecovery</code> interface are dynamically loaded, as controlled by properties with names beginning <code>com.arjuna.ats.jta.recovery.XAResourceRecovery</code>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>XARecoveryModule</code> will use the <code>XAResourceRecovery</code> implementation to get a <code>XAResource</code> to the target datasource.
On each invocation of <code>periodicWorkSecondPass</code>, the recovery module will issue an <code>XAResource.recover</code> request – this will (as described in the XA specification) return a list of the transaction identifiers (Xid&#8217;s) that are known to the datasource and are in an indeterminate (in-doubt) state.
The list of these in-doubt Xid&#8217;s received on successive passes (i.e. <code>periodicWorkSecondPass</code>-es) is compared.
Any Xid that appears in both lists, and for which no JTA <code>ResourceRecord</code> was found by the intervening transaction-initiated recovery is assumed to belong to a transaction that was involved in a crash before any JTA <code>ResourceRecord</code> was written, and a rollback is issued for that transaction on the <code>XAResource</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This double-scan mechanism is used because it is possible the Xid was obtained from the datasource just as the original application process was about to create the corresponding <code>JTA_ResourceRecord</code>.
The interval between the scans should allow time for the record to be written unless the application crashes (and if it does, rollback is the right answer).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An <code>XAResourceRecovery</code> implementation class can be written to contain all the information needed to perform recovery to some datasource.
Alternatively, a single class can handle multiple datasources.
The constructor of the implementation class must have an empty parameter list (because it is loaded dynamically), but the interface includes an initialise method which passes in further information as a string.
The content of the string is taken from the property value that provides the class name: everything after the first semi-colon is passed as the value of the string.
The use made of this string is determined by the <code>XAResourceRecovery</code> implementation class.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For further details on the way to implement a class that implements the interface <code>XAResourceRecovery</code>, read the JDBC chapter of the JTA Programming Guide.
An implementation class is provided that supports resource-initiated recovery for any XADataSource.
This class could be used as a template to build your own implementation class.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a failure occurs in the transaction environment after the transaction coordinator had told the <code>XAResource</code> to commit but before the transaction log has been updated to remove the participant, then recovery will attempt to replay the commit.
In the case of a Serialized <code>XAResource</code>, the response from the <code>XAResource</code> will enable the participant to be removed from the log, which will eventually be deleted when all participants have been committed.
However, if the <code>XAResource</code> is not recoverable then it is extremely unlikely that any <code>XAResourceRecovery</code> instance will be able to provide the recovery sub-system with a fresh <code>XAResource</code> to use in order to attempt recovery; in which case recovery will continually fail and the log entry will never be removed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two possible solutions to this problem:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Rely on the relevant <code>ExpiryScanner</code> to eventually move the log elsewhere.
Manual intervention will then be needed to ensure the log can be safely deleted.
If a log entry is moved, suitable warning messages will be output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set the <code>com.arjuna.ats.jta.xaAssumeRecoveryComplete</code> to true.
This option is checked whenever a new <code>XAResource</code> instance cannot be located from any registered <code>XAResourceRecovery</code> instance.
If false (the default), recovery assumes that there is a transient problem with the <code>XAResourceRecovery</code> instances (e.g., not all have been registered with the sub-system) and will attempt recovery periodically.
If true then recovery assumes that a previous commit attempt succeeded and this instance can be removed from the log with no further recovery attempts.
This option is global, so needs to be used with care since if used incorrectly <code>XAResource</code> instances may remain in an uncommitted state.</p>

<p>When recovering from failures, Narayana requires the ability to reconnect to databases that were in use prior to the failures in order to resolve any outstanding transactions.
Most connection information will be saved by the transaction service during its normal execution, and can be used during recovery to recreate the connection.
However, it is possible that not all such information will have been saved prior to a failure (for example, a failure occurs before such information can be saved, but after the database connection is used).
In order to recreate those connections it is necessary to provide implementations of the following Narayana interface <code>com.arjuna.ats.jta.recovery.XAResourceRecovery</code>, one for each database that may be used by an application.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The use of TCP/IP sockets for <code>TransactionStatusManager</code> and <code>RecoveryManager</code> provides for maximum flexibility in the deployment architecture.
It is often desirable to run the <code>RecoveryManager</code> in a separate JVM from the Transaction manager(s) for increased reliability.
In such deployments, TCP/IP provides for communication between the <code>RecoveryManager</code> and transaction manager(s), as detailed in the preceding sections.
Specifically, each JVM hosting a TransactionManager will run a <code>TransactionStatusManager</code> listener, through which the <code>RecoveryManager</code> can contact it to determine if a transaction is still live or not.
The <code>RecoveryManager</code> likewise listens on a socket, through which it can be contacted to perform recovery scans on demand.
The presence of a recovery listener is also used as a safety check when starting a <code>RecoveryManager</code>, since at most one should be running for a given <code>ObjectStore</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are some deployment scenarios in which there is only a single TransactionManager accessing the <code>ObjectStore</code> and the <code>RecoveryManager</code> is co-located in the same JVM.
For such cases the use of TCP/IP sockets for communication introduces unnecessary runtime overhead.
Additionally, if several such distinct processes are needed for e.g. replication or clustering, management of the TCP/IP port allocation can become unwieldy.
Therefore it may be desirable to configure for socketless recovery operation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The property <code>CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.transactionStatusManagerEnable</code> can be set to a value of NO to disable the <code>TransactionStatusManager</code> for any given <code>TransactionManager</code>.
Note that this must not be done if recovery runs in a separate process, as it may lead to incorrect recovery behavior in such cases.
For an in-process recovery manager, the system will use direct access to the <code>ActionStatusService</code> instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The property <code>RecoveryEnvironmentBean.recoveryListener</code> can likewise be used to disable the TCP/IP socket listener used by the recovery manager.
Care must be taken not to inadvertently start multiple recovery managers for the same <code>ObjectStore</code>, as this error, which may lead to significant crash recovery problems, cannot be automatically detected and prevented without the benefit of the socket listener.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>On each resource registration a <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> Object is expected to be created and returned to the application that invoked the register_resource operation.
Behind each CORBA object there should be an object implementation or Servant object, in POA terms, which performs operations made on a <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object.
Rather than to create a <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object with its associated servant on each register_resource, Narayana enhances performance by avoiding the creation of servants but it relies on a default <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object with it&#8217;s associated default servant to manage all <code>replay_completion</code> invocations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the next sections we first give an overview of the Portable Object Adapter architecture, then we describe how this architecture is used to provide <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> creation with optimization as explained above.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_understanding_poa"><a class="anchor" href="#_understanding_poa"></a>Understanding POA</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically, the Portable Object Adapter, or POA is an object that intercepts a client request and identifies the object that satisfies the client request.
The Object is then invoked and the response is returned to the client.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/failure-recovery-fig4-overview-of-poa.png" alt="failure recovery fig4 overview of poa">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 7. Overview of the POA</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The object that performs the client request is referred as a servant, which provides the implementation of the CORBA object requested by the client.
A servant provides the implementation for one or more CORBA object references.
To retreive a servant, each POA maintains an Active Object Map that maps all objects that have been activated in the POA to a servant.
For each incoming request, the POA looks up the object reference in the Active Object Map and tries to find the responsible servant.
If none is found, the request is either delegated to a default servant, or a servant manager is invoked to activate or locate an appropriate servant.
In addition to the name space for the objects, which are identified by Object Ids, a POA also provides a name space for POAs.
A POA is created as a child of an existing POA, which forms a hierarchy starting with the root POA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each POA has a set of policies that define its characteristics.
When creating a new POA, the default set of policies can be used or different values can be assigned that suit the application requirements.
The POA specification defines:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Thread policy – Specifies the threading model to be used by the POA.
Possible values are:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>ORB_CTRL_MODEL</code> – (default) The POA is responsible for assigning requests to threads.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>SINGLE_THREAD_MODEL</code> – the POA processes requests sequentially</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lifespan policy - specifies the lifespan of the objects implemented in the POA.
The lifespan policy can have the following values:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>TRANSIENT</code> (Default) Objects implemented in the POA cannot outlive the process in which they are first created.
Once the POA is deactivated, an <code>OBJECT_NOT_EXIST</code> exception occurs when attempting to use any object references generated by the POA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>PERSISTENT</code> Objects implemented in the POA can outlive the process in which they are first created.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Object ID Uniqueness policy - allows a single servant to be shared by many abstract objects.
The Object ID Uniqueness policy can have the following values:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>UNIQUE_ID</code> (Default) Activated servants support only one Object ID.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>MULTIPLE_ID</code> Activated servants can have one or more Object IDs.
The Object ID must be determined within the method being invoked at run time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>ID Assignment policy - specifies whether object IDs are generated by server applications or by the POA.
The ID Assignment policy can have the following values:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>USER_ID</code> is for persistent objects, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>SYSTEM_ID</code> is for transient objects</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Servant Retention policy - specifies whether the POA retains active servants in the Active Object Map.
The Servant Retention policy can have the following values:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>RETAIN</code> (Default) The POA tracks object activations in the Active Object Map.
<code>RETAIN</code> is usually used with ServantActivators or explicit activation methods on POA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>NON_RETAIN</code> The POA does not retain active servants in the Active Object Map.
<code>NON_RETAIN</code> is typically used with ServantLocators.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Request Processing policy - specifies how requests are processed by the POA.</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>USE_ACTIVE_OBJECT_MAP</code> (Default) If the Object ID is not listed in the Active Object Map, an <code>OBJECT_NOT</code> <code>_EXIST</code> exception is returned.
The POA must also use the RETAIN policy with this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>USE_DEFAULT_SERVANT</code> If the Object ID is not listed in the Active Object Map or the <code>NON_RETAIN</code> policy is set, the request is dispatched to the default servant.
If no default servant has been registered, an OBJ_ADAPTER exception is returned.
The POA must also use the MULTIPLE_ID policy with this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>USE_SERVANT_MANAGER</code> If the Object ID is not listed in the Active Object Map or the <code>NON_RETAIN</code> policy is set, the servant manager is used to obtain a servant.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>Implicit Activation policy - specifies whether the POA supports implicit activation of servants.
The Implicit Activation policy can have the following values:</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code> The POA supports implicit activation of servants.
Servants can be activated by converting them to an object reference with org.omg.PortableServer.POA.servant_to_reference() or by invoking _this()on the servant.
The POA must also use the SYSTEM_ID and RETAIN policies with this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>NO_IMPLICIT_ACTIVATION</code> (Default) The POA does not support implicit activation of servants.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It appears that to redirect <code>replay_completion</code> invocations to a default servant we need to create a POA with the Request Processing policy assigned with the value set to <code>USE_DEFAULT_SERVANT</code>.
However to reach that default Servant we should first reach the POA that forward the request to the default servant.
Indeed, the ORB uses a set of information to retrieve a POA; these information are contained in the object reference used by the client.
Among these information there are the IP address and the port number where resides the server and also the POA name.
To perform <code>replay_completion</code> invocations, the solution adopted by Narayana is to provide one Servant, per machine, and located in the <code>RecoveryManager</code> process, a separate process from client or server applications.
The next section explains how the indirection to a default Servant located on a separate process is provided for JacORB.</p>

<p>JacORB does not define additional policies to redirect any request on a <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object to a default servant located in the Recovery Manager process.
However it provides a set of APIs that allows building object references with specific IP address, port number and POA name in order to reach the appropriate default servant.</p>

<h5 id="_how_does_it_work"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_does_it_work"></a>How Does it work</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the Recovery Manager is launched it seeks in the configuration the <code>RecoveryActivator</code> that need be loaded.
Once done it invokes the <code>startRCservice</code> method of each loaded instances.
As seen in in the previous chapter (Recovery Manager ) the class to load that implements the <code>RecoveryActivator</code> interface is the class <code>RecoveryEnablement</code>.
This generic class, located in the package <code>com.arjuna.ats.internal.jts.orbspecific.recovery</code>, hides the nature of the ORB being used by the application (JacORB).
The following figure illustrates the behavior of the <code>RecoveryActivator</code> that leads to the creation of the default servant that performs <code>replay_completion</code> invocations requests.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the creation of the default servant, an object reference to a <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object is created and stored in the ObjectStore.
As we will see this object reference will be used to obtain its IP address, port number and POA name and assign them to any <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object reference created on register_resource.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When an application registers a resource with a transaction, a <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object reference is expected to be returned.
To build that object reference, the Transaction Service uses the <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object reference created within the Recovery Manager as a template.
The new object reference contains practically the same information to retrieve the default servant (IP address, port number, POA name, etc.), but the Object ID is changed; now, it contains the Transaction ID of the transaction in progress and also the Process ID of the process that is creating the new <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> object reference, as illustrated in <a href="#resource_registration">Resource registration and returned <code>RecoveryCoordinator</code> Object reference build from a referencestored in the ObjectStore.</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interfaces specified by the many transaction standards tend to be too low-level for most application programmers.
Therefore, Sun Microsystems created the Java Transaction API (JTA), which specifies higher-level interfaces to assist in the development of distributed transactional applications.
JTA was later renamed Jakarta Transactions and the specification is maintained at <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions" class="bare">https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note, these interfaces are still low-level.
You still need to implement state management and concurrency for transactional applications.
The interfaces are also optimized for applications which require XA resource integration capabilities, rather than the more general resources which other transactional APIs allow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With reference to Jakarta Transactions (<a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/" class="bare">https://jakarta.ee/specifications/transactions/</a>), distributed transaction services typically involve a number of participants:</p>

Jakarta Transactions is a high-level application interface that allows a transactional application to demarcate transaction boundaries, and also contains a mapping of the X/Open XA protocol.</p>

<h4 id="_resource_enlistment"><a class="anchor" href="#_resource_enlistment"></a>3.1.7. Resource enlistment</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically, an application server manages transactional resources, such as database connections, in conjunction with some resource adapter and optionally with connection pooling optimization.
For an external transaction manager to coordinate transactional work performed by the resource managers, the application server must enlist and de-list the resources used in the transaction.
These resources, called <em>participants</em>, are enlisted with the transaction so that they can be informed when the transaction terminates, by being driven through the two-phase commit protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As stated previously, Jakarta Transactions is much more closely integrated with the XA concept of resources than the arbitrary objects.
For each resource the application is using, the application server invokes the <code>enlistResource</code> method with an <code>XAResource</code> object which identifies the resource in use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The enlistment request causes the transaction manager to inform the resource manager to start associating the transaction with the work performed through the corresponding resource.
The transaction manager passes the appropriate flag in its <code>XAResource.start</code> method call to the resource manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>delistResource</code> method disassociates the specified resource from the transaction context in the target object.
The application server invokes the method with the two parameters: the <code>XAResource</code> object that represents the resource, and a flag to indicate whether the operation is due to the transaction being suspended (<code>TMSUSPEND</code>), a portion of the work has failed (<code>TMFAIL</code>), or a normal resource release by the application (<code>TMSUCCESS</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The de-list request causes the transaction manager to inform the resource manager to end the association of the transaction with the target <code>XAResource</code>. The flag value allows the application server to indicate whether it intends to come back to the same resource whereby the resource states must be kept intact.
The transaction manager passes the appropriate flag value in its <code>XAResource.end</code> method call to the underlying resource manager.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some transaction specifications and systems define a generic resource which can be used to register arbitrary resources with a transaction, the JTA is much more XA-specific.
Interface <code>javax.transaction.xa.XAResource</code> is a Java mapping of the XA interface.
The <code>XAResource</code> interface defines the contract between a <code>ResourceManager</code> and a <code>TransactionManager</code> in a distributed transaction processing environment.
A resource adapter for a <code>ResourceManager</code> implements the <code>XAResource</code> interface to support association of a top-level transaction to a resource such as a relational database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>XAResource</code> interface can be supported by any transactional resource adapter designed to be used in an environment where transactions are controlled by an external transaction manager, such a database management system.
An application may access data through multiple database connections.
Each database connection is associated with an <code>XAResource</code> object that serves as a proxy object to the underlying <code>ResourceManager</code> instance.
The transaction manager obtains an <code>XAResource</code> for each <code>ResourceManager</code> participating in a top-level transaction.
The <code>start</code> method associates the transaction with the resource, and the <code>end</code> method disassociates the transaction from the resource.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>ResourceManager</code> associates the transaction with all work performed on its data between invocation of <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> methods.
At transaction commit time, these transactional <code>ResourceManager</code> s are informed by the transaction manager to prepare, commit, or roll back the transaction according to the two-phase commit protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For better Java integration, the <code>XAResource</code> differs from the standard <code>XA</code> interface in the following ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The resource adapter implicitly initializes the <code>ResourceManager</code> when the resource (the connection) is acquired.
There is no equivalent to the <code>xa_open</code> method of the interface <code>XA</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>Rmid</code> is not passed as an argument.
Each <code>Rmid</code> is represented by a separate <code>XAResource</code> object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Asynchronous operations are not supported, because Java supports multi-threaded processing and most databases do not support asynchronous operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Error return values caused by the transaction manager&#8217;s improper handling of the <code>XAResource</code> object are mapped to Java exceptions via the <code>XAException</code> class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The DTP concept of Thread of Control maps to all Java threads that are given access to the <code>XAResource</code> and <code>Connection</code> objects.
For example, it is legal for two different threads to perform the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> operations on the same <code>XAResource</code> object.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_extended_xaresource_control"><a class="anchor" href="#_extended_xaresource_control"></a>Extended <code>XAResource</code> control</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, whenever an <code>XAResource</code> object is registered with a JTA-compliant transaction service, there is no way to manipulate the order in which it is invoked during the two-phase commit protocol, with respect to other <code>XAResource</code> objects.
Narayana, however, provides support for controlling the order via the two interfaces <code>com.arjuna.ats.jta.resources.StartXAResource</code> and <code>com.arjuna.ats.jta.resources.EndXAResource</code>.
By inheriting your <code>XAResource</code> instance from either of these interfaces, you control whether an instance of your class is invoked first or last, respectively.</p>

<p>The <em>ArjunaCore Development Guide</em> discusses the <em>Last Resource Commit optimization (LRCO)</em>, whereby a single resource that is only one-phase aware, and does not support the <code>prepare</code> phase, can be enlisted with a transaction that is manipulating two-phase aware participants.
This optimization is also supported within the Narayana.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to use the LRCO, your <code>XAResource</code> implementation must extend the <code>com.arjuna.ats.jta.resources.LastResourceCommitOptimisation</code> marker interface.
A marker interface is an interface which provides no methods.
When enlisting the resource via method <code>Transaction.enlistResource</code>, Narayana ensures that only a single instance of this type of participant is used within each transaction.
Your resource is driven last in the commit protocol, and no invocation of method <code>prepare</code> occurs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default an attempt to enlist more than one instance of a <code>LastResourceCommitOptimisation</code> class will fail and false will be returned from <code>Transaction.enlistResource</code>.
This behavior can be overridden by setting the <code>com.arjuna.ats.jta.allowMultipleLastResources</code> to true.
However, before doing so you should read the section on enlisting multiple one-phase aware resources.</p>

<p>One-phase commit is used to process a single one-phase aware resource, which does not conform to the two-phase commit protocol.
You can still achieve an atomic outcome across resources, by using the LRCO, as explained earlier.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Multiple one-phase-aware resources may be enlisted in the same transaction.
One example is when a legacy database runs within the same transaction as a legacy JMS implementation.
In such a situation, you cannot achieve atomicity of transaction outcome across multiple resources, because none of them enter the <code>prepare</code> state.
They commit or roll back immediately when instructed by the transaction coordinator, without knowledge of other resource states and without a way to undo if subsequent resources make a different choice.
This can result in data corruption or heuristic outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can approach these situations in two different ways:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Wrap the resources in compensating transactions.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The X/Open <code>XA</code> interface requires the transaction manager to initialize a resource manager, using method <code>xa_open</code>, before invoking any other of the interface&#8217;s methods.
JTA requires initialization of a resource manager to be embedded within the resource adapter that represents the resource manager.
The transaction manager does not need to know how to initialize a resource manager.
It only informs the resource manager about when to start and end work associated with a transaction and when to complete the transaction.
The resource adapter opens the resource manager when the connection to the resource manager is established.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_closing_a_resource_manager"><a class="anchor" href="#_closing_a_resource_manager"></a>3.2.3. Closing a resource manager</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The resource adapter closes a resource manager as a result of destroying the transactional resource.
A transaction resource at the resource adapter level is comprised of two separate objects:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>An <code>XAResource</code> object that allows the transaction manager to start and end the transaction association with the resource in use and to coordinate transaction completion process.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A connection object that allows the application to perform operations on the underlying resource, such as JDBC operations on an RDBMS.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once opened, the resource manager is kept open until the resource is released explicitly.
When the application invokes the connection&#8217;s <code>close</code> method, the resource adapter invalidates the connection object reference that was held by the application and notifies the application server about the close.
The transaction manager invokes the <code>XAResource.end</code> method to disassociate the transaction from that connection.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The close notification triggers the application server to perform any necessary cleanup work and to mark the physical XA connection as free for reuse, if connection pooling is in place.</p>

<h4 id="_thread_of_control"><a class="anchor" href="#_thread_of_control"></a>3.2.4. Thread of control</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The X/Open <code>XA</code> interface specifies that the transaction-association-related <em>xa</em> calls must be invoked from the same thread context.
This <em>thread-of-control</em> requirement does not apply to the object-oriented component-based application run-time environment, in which application threads are dispatched dynamically as methods are invoked.. Different threads may use the same connection resource to access the resource manager if the connection spans multiple method invocation.
Depending on the implementation of the application server, different threads may be involved with the same <code>XAResource</code> object.
The resource context and the transaction context operate independent of thread context.
This creates the possibility of different threads invoking the <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the application server allows multiple threads to use a single <code>XAResource</code> object and the associated connection to the resource manager, the application server must ensure that only one transaction context is associated with the resource at any point of time.
Thus the <code>XAResource</code> interface requires the resource managers to support the two-phase commit protocol from any thread context.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_transaction_association"><a class="anchor" href="#_transaction_association"></a>3.2.5. Transaction association</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A transaction is associated with a transactional resource via the <code>start</code> method and disassociated from the resource via the <code>end</code> method.
The resource adapter internally maintains an association between the resource connection object and the <code>XAResource</code> object.
At any given time, a connection is associated with zero or one transaction.
JTA does not support nestedtransactions, so attempting to invoke the <code>start</code> method on a thread that is already associated with a transaction is an error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transaction manager can Interleave multiple transaction contexts using the same resource, as long as methods <code>start</code> and <code>end</code> are invoked properly for each transaction context switch.
Each time the resource is used with a different transaction, the method <code>end</code> must be invoked for the previous transaction that was associated with the resource, and method <code>start</code> must be invoked for the current transaction context.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_externally_controlled_connections"><a class="anchor" href="#_externally_controlled_connections"></a>3.2.6. Externally controlled connections</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For a transactional application whose transaction states are managed by an application server, its resources must also be managed by the application server so that transaction association is performed properly.
If an application is associated with a transaction, the application must not perform transactional work through the connection without having the connection&#8217;s resource object already associated with the global transaction.
The application server must ensure that the <code>XAResource</code> object in use is associated with the transaction, by invoking the <code>Transaction.enlistResource</code> method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a server-side transactional application retains its database connection across multiple client requests, the application server must ensure that before dispatching a client request to the application thread, the resource is enlisted with the application&#8217;s current transaction context.
This implies that the application server manages the connection resource usage status across multiple method invocations.</p>

<h4 id="_resource_sharing"><a class="anchor" href="#_resource_sharing"></a>3.2.7. Resource sharing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the same transactional resource is used to interleave multiple transactions, the application server must ensure that only one transaction is enlisted with the resource at any given time.
To initiate the transaction commit process, the transaction manager is allowed to use any of the resource objects connected to the same resource manager instance.
The resource object used for the two-phase commit protocol does not need to have been involved with the transaction being completed.</p>

<h4 id="_transaction_timeouts"><a class="anchor" href="#_transaction_timeouts"></a>3.2.9. Transaction timeouts</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can associate timeout values with transactions in order to control their lifetimes.
If the timeout value elapses before a transaction terminates, by committing or rolling back, the transaction system rolls it back.
The <code>XAResource</code> interface supports a <code>setTransactionTimeout</code> operation, which allows the timeout associated with the current transaction to be propagated to the resource manager and if supported, overrides any default timeout associated with the resource manager.
Overriding the timeout can be useful when long-running transactions may have lifetimes that would exceed the default, and using the default timeout would cause the resource manager to roll back before the transaction terminates, and cause the transaction to roll back as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If You do not explicitly set a timeout value for a transaction, or you use a value of <code>0</code>, an implementation-specific default value may be used.
In Narayana, property value <code>CoordinatorEnvironmentBean.defaultTimeout</code> represents this implementation-specific default, in seconds.
The default value is 60 seconds.
A value of <code>0</code> disables default transaction timeouts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, imposing the same timeout as the transaction on a resource manager is not always appropriate.
One example is that your business rules may require you to have control over the lifetimes on resource managers without allowing that control to be passed to some external entity.
Narayana supports an all-or-nothing approach to whether or not method <code>setTransactionTimeout</code> is called on <code>XAResource</code> instances.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the <code>JTAEnvironmentBean.xaTransactionTimeoutEnabled</code> property is set to <code>true</code>, which is the default, it is called on all instances.
Otherwise, use the <code>setXATransactionTimeoutEnabled</code> method of <code>com.arjuna.ats.jta.common.Configuration</code> .</p>

<h5 id="_checking_transactions"><a class="anchor" href="#_checking_transactions"></a>Checking transactions</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a multi-threaded application, multiple threads may be associated with a transaction during its lifetime, sharing the context.
In addition, it is possible that if one thread terminates a transaction, other threads may still be active within it.
In a distributed environment, it can be difficult to guarantee that all threads have finished with a transaction when it is terminated.
By default, ArjunaCore will issue a warning if a thread terminates a transaction when other threads are still active within it.
However, it will allow the transaction termination to continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Other solutions to this problem are possible.
One example would be to block the thread which is terminating the transaction until all other threads have disassociated themselves from the transaction context.
Therefore, ArjunaCore provides the <code>com.arjuna.ats.arjuna.coordinator.CheckedAction</code> class, which allows the thread or transaction termination policy to be overridden.
Each transaction has an instance of this class associated with it, and application programmers can provide their own implementations on a per transaction basis.</p>

<p>When a thread attempts to terminate the transaction and there are active threads within it, the system will invoke the <code>check</code> method on the transaction&#8217;s <em>CheckedAction</em> object.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, the Transaction Service executes the <code>commit</code> protocol of a top-level transaction in a synchronous manner.
All registered resources will be told to prepare in order by a single thread, and then they will be told to commit or rollback.
This has several possible disadvantages:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>In the case of many registered resources, the <code>prepare</code> operating can logically be invoked in parallel on each resource.
The disadvantage is that if an "early" resource in the list of registered resource forces a rollback during <code>prepare</code>, possibly many prepare operations will have been made needlessly.</p>

<p>This implementation is based on a traditional transaction log.
All transaction states within the same process (VM instance) are written to the same log (file), which is an append-only entity.
When transaction data would normally be deleted, e.g., at the end of the transaction, a delete record is added to the log instead.
Therefore, the log just keeps growing.
Periodically a thread runs to prune the log of entries that have been deleted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A log is initially given a maximum capacity beyond which it cannot grow.
Once this is reached the system will create a new log for transactions that could not be accommodated in the original log.
The new log and the old log are pruned as usual.
During the normal execution of the transaction system there may be an arbitrary number of log instances.
These should be garbage collected by the system (or the recovery sub-system) eventually.</p>

<p>The WildFly Application Server provides a command-line based Management CLI which supports the ability to browse and manipulate transaction records.
This functionality is provided by the interaction between the Transaction Manager &#8482; and the Management API of the application server.
To start the CLI on a non-windows based OS type the following command in application server install directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="shell">./bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect controller=IP_ADDRESS</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Windows platforms use the jboss-cli.bat script</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transaction manager stores information about each active transaction, and the participants involved in the transaction, in a persistent storage area called the <em>object store</em> . The Management API exposes the object store as a resource called the <code>log-store</code> . An API operation called <code>probe</code> reads the transaction logs and creates a node in the management model corresponding to each log.
These nodes can be inspected using the CLI.
Transaction logs are transient, so these nodes quickly become out of date but you can call the <code>probe</code> command manually whenever you need to refresh the <code>log-store</code>.</p>
</div>
<div id="refresh_log_store" class="paragraph">
<div class="title">Refresh the Log Store</div>
<p>This command refreshes the Log Store for server groups which use the profile <code>default</code> in a managed domain.
For a standalone server, remove the <code>profile=default</code> from the command.</p>

<p>Transaction logs may also be managed using <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jmx">JMX</a>.
Each transaction log record is instrumented as an MBean.
Any JMX client may be used to manage logs using this mechanism.</p>

<p>The JMX MBean for the object store contains one method and one attribute.
The <code>probe</code> operation scans the object store creating JMX MBeans for the various log records contained in the store.
The default behaviour is to only create MBeans for particular record types.
If there is a need to view everything in the store then set the <code>ExposeAllRecordsAsMBeans</code> attribute to <code>true</code> Note that transaction logs are transient so these beans quickly become out of date and will not be refreshed automatically so you must invoke the <code>probe</code> operation again to get the current up to date list of MBeans.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation reads most bean properties only once, as the consuming component or class is instantiated.
This usually happens the first time a transaction is run.
As a result, calling <code>setter</code> methods to change the value of bean properties while the system is running typically has no effect, unless it is done prior to any use of the transaction system.
Altered bean properties are not persisted back to the properties file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can configure the system using a bean wiring system such as JBoss Microcontainer or Spring.
Take care when instantiating beans, to obtain the singleton via the static getter (factory) method on the module property manager.
Using a new bean instantiated with the default constructor is ineffective, since it is not possible to pass this configured bean back to the property management system.</p>

<h4 id="_ws_ba_participant_completion_race_condition"><a class="anchor" href="#_ws_ba_participant_completion_race_condition"></a>3.7.1. WS-BA Participant-Completion Race Condition</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WS-BA participant-completion protocol has a benign race condition that, in unusual circumstances, can cause some Business Activities to be cancelled that would have otherwise been able to close.
This is safe as no inconsistency arrises, but it can be annoying for users.
This section explains why this can happen, under what conditions, and what you can do to tolerate it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_whats_happening_in_a_nutshell"><a class="anchor" href="#_whats_happening_in_a_nutshell"></a>What&#8217;s happening, in a nutshell</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine a scenario where the client begins a business activity and then invokes a Web service.
If the Web service uses participant completion, it will notify the coordinator when it has completed its work and then return control to the client.
This notification is asynchronous, so it&#8217;s possible that the client will then ask the coordinator to close the activity before the coordinator processes (or even receives) the completed notification from the participant.
In this situation the coordinator will cancel the activity as not all participants (from its perspective) have completed their work.
As a result all completed participants are compensated (including, eventually, the participant with the late 'completed' notification) and the client receives a <code>TransactionRolledBackException</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_when_is_it_most_likely_to_happen"><a class="anchor" href="#_when_is_it_most_likely_to_happen"></a>When is it most likely to happen?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Typically this happens when the client, coordinator and participant are running inside the same VM.
This scenario is unlikely to happen in production, but can happen regularly during development where a single VM is used to keep things simple.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_how_do_i_know_if_this_is_affecting_my_application"><a class="anchor" href="#_how_do_i_know_if_this_is_affecting_my_application"></a>How do I know if this is affecting my application?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the client is occasionally receiving a <code>TransactionRolledbackException</code> when calling <code>UserBusinessActivity#close()</code>, but none of the machines involved in running the transaction have crashed, you could be affected by this.
Especially if you are running the client, coordinator and participant(s) in the same server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following log message will help you identify this issue:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Example Environment Bean</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code>WARN [com.arjuna.mw.wstx] (TaskWorker-2) ARJUNA045062: Coordinator cancelled the activity</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is only an indication that you are seeing this issue as the coordinator can elect to cancel the activity for other reasons.
For example, network problems might mean the coordinator cannot tell the web service to close the activity.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_why_cant_it_be_avoided"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_cant_it_be_avoided"></a>Why can&#8217;t it be avoided?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the protocol to avoid this issue, it would need to make the complete message synchronous, throttling throughput by slowing down both the participant and coordinator and holding sockets open for longer.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_what_can_the_application_do_to_tolerate_this"><a class="anchor" href="#_what_can_the_application_do_to_tolerate_this"></a>What can the application do to tolerate this?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A real, distributed deployment will rarely see this problem because communication latency between client, participant and coordinator will dominate the race condition.
Even if it does happen your application should tolerate it.
Transaction rollbacks and activity cancelations are inevitable in a distributed environment and can happen for many reasons.
When handling <code>TransactionRolledBack</code> exceptions you can either retry the Transaction/Activity or notify the caller of the failure.
What you choose to do will depend on the requirements of your application.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_why_exactly_does_this_happen"><a class="anchor" href="#_why_exactly_does_this_happen"></a>Why exactly does this happen?</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First consider the following client code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="title">Client Code Example</div>
<div class="content">
<pre class="CodeRay highlight"><code data-lang="java">UserBusinessActivity uba = UserBusinessActivityFactory.userBusinessActivity();
uba.begin();
myWebServiceClient.invoke();
uba.close();</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The client code is very simple, it just begins a business activity, invokes a Web service and then closes the business activity.
The Web service uses the Participant-Completion protocol and so notifies the coordinator of completion just before returning control to the client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a diagram showing the pertinent message exchanges that occur under a normal situation.</p>

<li>

This represents the response to the client&#8217;s application request.</p>
</li>
<li>

It then waits for a <code>closed</code> or failure response from the coordinator.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>5a.close</code> and <code>5b.closed</code>.
The coordinator has processed the <code>2.completed</code> message so can close the activity.
It starts by sending the <code>close</code> message to the participant and waits for the <code>closed</code> response as confirmation.
These two messages are asynchronous.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>6.closed</code>.
The coordinator now has all <code>closed</code> acknowledgments so notifies the client that the activity successfully <code>closed</code>.</p>

<p><code>Party 2</code>. The response <code>3.response</code> followed by <code>4.close</code>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When running in the same VM, or on a low latency network, <code>3.response</code> will be sent very quickly.
This is because it is simply travelling on the HTTP response over an already open socket.
This just leaves messages <code>2.completed</code> and <code>4.close</code> which will take much longer relative to <code>3.response</code>.
To understand this, lets take a look at what happens when an asynchronous Web service call is made:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The client sends the message to the Web service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The server-side SOAP stack uses an existing thread from a pool dedicated to receiving SOAP messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the service is asynchronous, the message will be passed to another thread to be processed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The receiving thread will now return the HTTP response.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The race condition occurs because steps 1-3 can happen relatively quickly in a single VM, and thus it&#8217;s likely that both messages 2 and 4, will be waiting to be processed at the same time.
The order in which they are processed is dependent on the implementation of the thread pool and is also at the mercy of thread scheduling in the VM, so it&#8217;s possible that either could be processed first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This race condition is much less likely to happen in a distributed environment as the network costs will be significantly higher.
As a result message <code>3.response</code> will take long enough to send, so as to give message <code>2.completed</code> enough of a head start.
But it is still possible so the client application must be coded defensively to catch and handle a <code>TransactionRollbackException</code>.
The client code ought to be doing this anyway to deal with server crashes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following diagram shows what messages are exchanged when the race condition occurs.
Notice that the activity ends in a consistent state.</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Messages 1-3 are omitted from the following explanation as they are the same as in the success case.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>4.close</code>.
This message is processed by the coordinator before message <code>2.completed</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>5a.cancel</code>.
The coordinator has not yet processed the <code>2.completed</code> message so cannot close the activity.
The coordinator then sends a 'cancel' message to the participant as it thinks it has not yet completed.
This message and subsequent retires, are dropped by the participant as they are not valid for a completed participant.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>5b.compensate</code>/<code>5c.compensated</code>.
After one or more unacknowledged <code>cancel</code> messages, the coordinator switches to sending <code>compensate</code> messages which will cause the participant to compensate the work.
The participant acknowledges with a <code>compensated</code> reply.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6. Transaction rolledback exception.
The coordinator notifies the client that the activity failed to close.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see from the steps above, when this race condition arises, any work done by participants is compensated and the client is notified of the outcome.
Thus a consistent outcome is achieved.</p>

<p>The <em>XML Transaction Service (XTS)</em> component of Narayana supports the coordination of private and public Web Services in a business transaction.
Therefore, to understand XTS, you must be familiar with Web Services, and also understand something about transactions.
This chapter introduces XTS and provides a brief overview of the technologies that form the Web Services standard.
Additionally, this chapter explores some of the fundamentals of transactioning technology and how it can be applied to Web Services.
Much of the content presented in this chapter is detailed throughout this guide.
However, only overview information about Web Services is provided.
If you are new to creating Web services, please consult your Web Services platform documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Narayana provides the XTS component as a transaction solution for Web Services.
Using XTS, business partners can coordinate complex business transactions in a controlled and reliable manner.
The XTS API supports a transactional coordination model based on the <em>WS-Coordination</em>, <em>WS-Atomic Transaction</em>, and <em>WS-Business Activity</em> specifications.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Protocols Included in XTS* WS-Coordination (WS-C) is a generic coordination framework developed by IBM, Microsoft and BEA.</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>WS-Atomic Transaction (WS-AT) and WS-Business Activity (WS-BA) together comprise the WS-Transaction (WS-T) transaction protocols that utilize this framework.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Narayana implements versions 1.1, and 1.2 of these three specifications.

<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>Web Services</em> are modular, reusable software components that are created by exposing business functionality through a Web service interface.
Web Services communicate directly with other Web Services using standards-based technologies such as SOAP and HTTP.
These standards-based communication technologies enable customers, suppliers, and trading partners to access Web Services, independent of hardware operating system, or programming environment.
The result is a vastly improved collaboration environment as compared to today&#8217;s EDI and <em>business-to-business (B2B)</em> solutions, an environment where businesses can expose their current and future business applications as Web Services that can be easily discovered and accessed by external partners.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web Services, by themselves, are not fault-tolerant.
In fact, some of the reasons that the Web Services model is an attractive development solution are also the same reasons that service-based applications may have drawbacks.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Properties of Web Services</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Application components that are exposed as Web Services may be owned by third parties, which provides benefits in terms of cost of maintenance, but drawbacks in terms of having exclusive control over their behavior.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web Services are usually remotely located, increasing risk of failure due to increased network travel for invocations.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications that have high dependability requirements need a method of minimizing the effects of errors that may occur when an application consumes Web Services.
One method of safeguarding against such failures is to interact with an application&#8217;s Web Services within the context of a <em>transaction</em>.
A transaction is a unit of work which is completed entirely, or in the case of failures is reversed to some agreed consistent state.
The goal, in the event of a failure, is normally to appear as if the work had never occurred in the first place.
With XTS, transactions can span multiple Web Services, meaning that work performed across multiple enterprises can be managed with transactional support.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_managing_service_based_processes"><a class="anchor" href="#_managing_service_based_processes"></a>4.1.1. Managing service-Based Processes</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XTS allows you to create transactions that drive complex business processes, spanning multiple Web Services.
Current Web Services standards do not address the requirements for a high-level coordination of services.
This is because in today&#8217;s Web Services applications, which use single request/response interactions, coordination is typically not a problem.
However, for applications that engage multiple services among multiple business partners, coordinating and controlling the resulting interactions is essential.
This becomes even more apparent when you realize that you generally have little in the way of formal guarantees when interacting with third-party Web Services.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XTS provides the infrastructure for coordinating services during a business process.
By organizing processes as transactions, business partners can collaborate on complex business interactions in a reliable manner, insuring the integrity of their data - usually represented by multiple changes to a database – but without the usual overheads and drawbacks of directly exposing traditional transaction-processing engines directly onto the web.
<a href="#example_application">An Evening On the Town</a> demonstrates how an application may manage service-based processes as transactions:</p>
</div>
<div id="example_application" class="paragraph">
<div class="title">An Evening On the Town</div>
<p>The application in question allows a user to plan a social evening.
This application is responsible for reserving a table at a restaurant, and reserving tickets to a show.
Both activities are paid for using a credit card.
In this example, each service represents exposed Web Services provided by different service providers.
XTS is used to envelop the interactions between the theater and restaurant services into a single (potentially) long-running business transaction.
The business transaction must insure that seats are reserved both at the restaurant and the theater.
If one event fails the user has the ability to decline both events, thus returning both services back to their original state.
If both events are successful, the user&#8217;s credit card is charged and both seats are booked.
As you may expect, the interaction between the services must be controlled in a reliable manner over a period of time.
In addition, management must span several third-party services that are remotely deployed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without the backing of a transaction, an undesirable outcome may occur.
For example, the user credit card may be charged, even if one or both of the bookings fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="#example_application">An Evening On the Town</a> describes the situations where XTS excels at supporting business processes across multiple enterprises.
This example is further refined throughout this guide, and appears as a standard demonstrator (including source code) with the XTS distribution.</p>

<h4 id="_servlets"><a class="anchor" href="#_servlets"></a>4.1.2. Servlets</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WS-Coordination, WS-Atomic Transaction, and WS-Business Activity protocols are based on one-way interactions of entities rather than traditional synchronous request/response RPC-style interactions.
One group of entities, called transaction participants, invoke operations on other entities, such as the transaction coordinator, in order to return responses to requests.
The programming model is based on peer-to-peer relationships, with the result that all services, whether they are participants, coordinators or clients, must have an <em>active component</em> that allows them to receive unsolicited messages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In XTS, the active component is achieved through deployment of JaxWS endpoints.
Each XTS endpoint that is reachable through SOAP/XML is published via JaxWS, without developer intevention.
The only requirement is that transactional client applications and transactional web services must reside within a domain capable of hosting JaxWS endpoints, such as an application server.
WildFly Application Server can provide this functionality.</p>

For each operation, WSDL describes the format that the client must follow.</p>

<p>XTS integrates WS-AT transactions with JTA.
To invoke a web service inside a WS-AT transaction, simply start a new JTA transaction and invoke the web service.
By default, XTS will create a WS-AT context and pass it with your request.
See our quickstarts for an example: <a href="quickstarts_overview.html#ref_wsatmultiservice">WS-AT Multi-Service</a> and <a href="quickstarts_overview.html#ref_wsatmultihop">WS-AT Multi-Hop</a></p>

To make your web service WS-AT compliant, annotate your web service class or method with the EJB 3 <code>jakarta.ejb.TransactionAttribute</code> annotation or the JTA <code>jakarta.transaction.Transactional annotation</code>.
XTS will automatically translate WS-AT context, received with the request, to JTA.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two parts to implementing a Web service using XTS are the transaction management and the business logic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bulk of the transaction management aspects are organized in a clear and easy-to-implement model by means of the XTS&#8217;s <em>Participant API</em>, provides a structured model for negotiation between the web service and the transaction coordinator.
It allows the web service to manage its own local transactional data, in accordance with the needs of the business logic, while ensuring that its activities are in step with those of the client and other services involved in the transaction.
Internally, this API uses SOAP to invokes operations on the various WS-C and WS-AT services, to drive the transaction to completion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <em>participant</em> is a software entity which is driven by the transaction manager on behalf of a Web service.
When a web service wants to participate in a particular transaction, it must enroll a participant to act as a proxy for the service in subsequent negotiations with the coordinator.
The participant implements an API appropriate to the type of transaction it is enrolled in, and the participant model selected when it is enrolled.
For example, a <code>Durable2PC</code> participant, as part of a WS-Atomic Transaction, implements the <code>Durable2PCParticipant</code> interface.
The use of participants allows the transactional control management aspects of the Web service to be factored into the participant implementation, while staying separate from the rest of the Web service&#8217;s business logic and private transactional data management.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The creation of participants is not trivial, since they ultimately reflect the state of a Web service&#8217;s back-end processing facilities, an aspect normally associated with an enterprise&#8217;s own IT infrastructure.
Implementations must use one of the following interfaces: <code>com.arjuna.wst11.Durable2PCParticipant</code>, <code>com.arjuna.wst11.Volatile2PCParticipant</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can enable transaction propagation for all Web service calls that are invoked within a JTA, WS-AT or WS-BA transaction.
This is done with the <code>default-context-propagation</code> property in the XTS subsystem config of the <code>standalone-xts.xml</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As this is enabled by default (for <code>standalone-xts.xml</code>), calls to all Web services that support WS-AT or WS-BA will automatically receive the transaction context allowing them to participate in the distributed transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transaction context is simply ignored if the service does not support WS-AT or WS-BA.
This is done by setting <code>MustUnderstand="false"</code> on the <code>CoordinationContext</code> SOAP header.
Unfortunately, this may cause issues when invoking WS-AT or WS-BA enabled Web services on other vendors' application servers.
This is because the WS-Coordination specification states that <code>MustUnderstand</code> must be set to true.
If you are affected by this issue, you will need to explicitly enable the transaction propagation for every port.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default context propagation policy can also be overridden on a per Web Service port basis.
This allows the developer to easily state which Web Service clients must and must-not propagate the transaction context.
This is done through the standard JAX-WS WebServiceFeature facility.
A JAX-WS <code>WebServiceFeature</code> allows meta-information to be added to a port that describe cross-cutting behaviour, such as logging, security or compression.
In our case we use the <a href="xts_api.html#ref_jtaoverwsatfeature">JTAOverWSATFeature</a> and <a href="xts_api.html#ref_wstxfeature">WSTXFeature</a> features.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The developer may also state that the transaction must-not be distributed over calls to this Web service.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>participant</code> is the entity that performs the work pertaining to transaction management on behalf of the business services involved in an application.
The Web service (in the example code, a theater booking system) contains some business logic to reserve a seat and inquire about availability, but it needs to be supported by something that maintains information in a durable manner.
Typically this is a database, but it could be a file system, NVRAM, or other storage mechanism.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although the service may talk to the back-end database directly, it cannot commit or undo any changes, since committing and rolling back are ultimately under the control of a transaction.
For the transaction to exercise this control, it must communicate with the database.
In XTS, participant does this communication, as shown in <a href="#fig_participant_backend_control">Transactions, Participants, and Back-End Transaction Control</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Implementing a participant is a relatively straightforward task.
However, depending on the complexity of the transactional infrastructure that the participant needs to manage, the task can vary greatly in complexity and scope.
Your implementation needs to implement one of the interfaces found under <code>com.arjuna.wst</code>.</p>

<h6 id="_deploying_participants"><a class="anchor" href="#_deploying_participants"></a>Deploying Participants</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transactional web services and transactional clients are regular Jakarta EE applications and can be deployed into the application server in the same way as any other Jakarta EE application.
The XTS Subsystem exports all the client and web service API classes needed to manage transactions and enroll and manage participant web services.
It provides implementations of all the WS-C and WS-T coordination services, not just the coordinator services.
In particular, it exposes the client and web service participant endpoints which are needed to receive incoming messages originating from the coordinator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Normally, a transactional application client and the transaction web service it invokes will be deployed in different application servers.
As long as XTS is enabled on each of these containers it will transparently route coordination messages from clients or web services to their coordinator and vice versa.
When the client begins a transaction by default it creates a context using the coordination services in its local container.
The context holds a reference to the local Registration Service which means that any web services enlisted in the transaction enrol with the coordination services in the same container.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coordinator does not need to reside in the same container as the client application.
By configuring the client deployment appropriately it is possible to use the coordinator services co-located with one of the web services or even to use services deployed in a separate, dedicated container.
See Chapter 8 Stand-Alone Coordination for details of how to configure a coordinator located in a different container to the client.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, coordination contexts are obtained from the local coordinator.
Therefore, WS-AT transactions or WS-BA activities created by a locally-deployed client application are supplied with a context which identifies the Registration Service running on the client&#8217;s machine.
Any Web Services invoked by the client are coordinated by the Transaction Protocol services running on the client&#8217;s host.
This is the case whether the Web Services are running locally or remotely.
Such a configuration is called <em>local coordination</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can reconfigure this setting globally for all clients, causing context creation requests to be redirected to an Activation Coordinator Service running on a remote host.
Normally, the rest of the coordination process is executed from the remote host.
This configuration is called <em>stand-alone coordination</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<div class="title">Reasons for Choosing a Stand-Alone Coordinator</div>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Efficiency: if a client application invokes Web Services on a remote WildFly Application Server, coordinating the transaction from the remote server might be more efficient, since the protocol-specific messages between the coordinator and the participants do not need to travel over the network.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reliability: if the coordinator service runs on a dedicated host, there is no danger of failing applications or services affecting the coordinator and causing failures for unrelated transactions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A third reason might be to use a coordination service provided by a third party vendor.</p>

<li>
<p>The first case is where the client is expected to use an XTS coordinator deployed in another WildFly Application Server.
If, for example, this WildFly Application Server is bound to address <code>10.0.1.99</code> , setting property <code>coordinator.address</code> to <code>10.0.1.99</code> is normally all that is required to configure the coordinator URL to identity the remote WildFly Application Server&#8217;s coordination service.
If the Web service on the remote WildFly Application Server were reset to <code>9090</code> then it would also be necessary to set property <code>coordinator.port</code> to this value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The second common use case is where communications between client and coordinator, and between participant and coordinator, must use secure connections.
If property <code>coordinator.scheme</code> is set to value <code>https</code>, the client&#8217;s request to begin a transaction is sent to the coordinator service over a secure https connection.
The XTS coordinator and participant services will ensure that all subsequent communications between coordinator and client or coordinator and web services also employ secure https connections.
Note that this requires configuring the trust stores in the WildFly Application Server running the client, coordinator and participant web services with appropriate trust certificates.</p>

<h3 id="_participant_crash_recovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_participant_crash_recovery"></a>4.5. Participant Crash Recovery</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A key requirement of a transaction service is to be resilient to a system crash by a host running a participant, as well as the host running the transaction coordination services.
Crashes which happen before a transaction terminates or before a business activity completes are relatively easy to accommodate.
The transaction service and participants can adopt a <code>presumed abort</code> policy.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<div class="title">Procedure: Presumed Abort Policy</div>
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>If the coordinator crashes, it can assume that any transaction it does not know about is invalid, and reject a participant request which refers to such a transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the participant crashes, it can forget any provisional changes it has made, and reject any request from the coordinator service to prepare a transaction or complete a business activity.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Crash recovery is more complex if the crash happens during a transaction commit operation, or between completing and closing a business activity.
The transaction service must ensure as far as possible that participants arrive at a consistent outcome for the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">WS-AT Transaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>The transaction needs to commit all provisional changes or roll them all back to the state before the transaction started.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">WS-Business Activity Transaction</dt>
<dd>
<p>All participants need to close the activity or cancel the activity, and run any required compensating actions.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the rare occasions where such a consensus cannot be reached, the transaction service must log and report transaction failures.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XTS includes support for automatic recovery of WS-AT and WS-BA transactions, if either or both of the coordinator and participant hosts crashes.
The XTS recovery manager begins execution on coordinator and participant hosts when the XTS service restarts.
On a coordinator host, the recovery manager detects any WS-AT transactions which have prepared but not committed, as well as any WS-BA transactions which have completed but not yet closed.
It ensures that all their participants are rolled forward in the first case, or closed in the second.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On a participant host, the recovery manager detects any prepared WS-AT participants which have not responded to a transaction rollback, and any completed WS-BA participants which have not yet responded to an activity cancel request, and ensures that the former are rolled back and the latter are compensated.
The recovery service also allows for recovery of subordinate WS-AT transactions and their participants if a crash occurs on a host where an interposed WS-AT coordinator has been employed.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_ws_at_recovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_ws_at_recovery"></a>4.5.1. WS-AT Recovery</h4>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_ws_at_coordinator_crash_recovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_ws_at_coordinator_crash_recovery"></a>WS-AT Coordinator Crash Recovery</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WS-AT coordination service tracks the status of each participant in a transaction as the transaction progresses through its two-phase commit.
When all participants have been sent a <code>prepare</code> message and have responded with a <code>prepared</code> message, the coordinator writes a log record storing each participant&#8217;s details, indicating that the transaction is ready to complete.
If the coordinator service crashes after this point has been reached, completion of the two-phase commit protocol is still guaranteed, by reading the log file after reboot and sending a <code>commit</code> message to each participant.
Once all participants have responded to the <code>commit</code> with a <code>committed</code> message, the coordinator can safely delete the log entry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since the <code>prepared</code> messages returned by the participants imply that they are ready to commit their provisional changes and make them permanent, this type of recovery is safe.
Additionally, the coordinator does not need to account for any commit messages which may have been sent before the crash, or resend messages if it crashes several times.
The XTS participant implementation is resilient to redelivery of the <code>commit</code> messages.
If the participant has implemented the recovery functions described in <a href="#ws_at_recovery_api">WS-AT Participant Crash Recovery APIs</a>, the coordinator can guarantee delivery of <code>commit</code> messages if both it crashes, and one or more of the participant service hosts also crash, at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the coordination service crashes before the <code>prepare</code> phase completes, the presumed abort protocol ensures that participants are rolled back.
After system restart, the coordination service has the information about about all the transactions which could have entered the <code>commit</code> phase before the reboot, since they have entries in the log.
It also knows about any active transactions started after the reboot.
If a participant is waiting for a response, after sending its <code>prepared</code> message, it automatically re-sends the <code>prepared</code> message at regular intervals.
When the coordinator detects a transaction which is not active and has no entry in the log file after the reboot, it instructs the participant to abort, ensuring that the web service gets a chance to roll back any provisional state changes it made on behalf of the transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A web service may decide to unilaterally commit or roll back provisional changes associated with a given participant, if configured to time-out after a specified length of time without a response.
In this situation, the the web service should record this action and log a message to persistent storage.
When the participant receives a request to commit or roll back, it should throw an exception if its unilateral decision action does not match the requested action.
The coordinator detects the exception and logs a message marking the outcome as heuristic.
It also saves the state of the transaction permanently in the transaction log, to be inspected and reconciled by an administrator.</p>

<p>WS-AT participants associated with a transactional web service do not need to be involved in crash recovery if the Web service&#8217;s host machine crashes before the participant is told to prepare.
The coordinator will assume that the transaction has aborted, and the Web service can discard any information associated with unprepared transactions when it reboots.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a participant is told to <code>prepare</code>, the Web service is expected to save to persistent storage the transactional state it needs to commit or roll back the transaction.
The specific information it needs to save is dependent on the implementation and business logic of the Web Service.
However, the participant must save this state before returning a <code>prepared</code> vote from the <code>prepare</code> call.
If the participant cannot save the required state, or there is some other problem servicing the request made by the client, it must return an <code>aborted</code> vote.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The XTS participant services running on a Web Service&#8217;s host machine cooperate with the Web service implementation to facilitate participant crash recovery.
These participant services are responsible for calling the participant&#8217;s <code>prepare</code>, <code>commit</code>, and <code>rollback</code> methods.
The XTS implementation tracks the local state of every enlisted participant.
If the <code>prepare</code> call returns a <code>prepared</code> vote, the XTS implementation ensures that the participant state is logged to the local transaction log before forwarding a <code>prepared</code> message to the coordinator.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A participant log record contains information identifying the participant, its transaction, and its coordinator.
This is enough information to allow the rebooted XTS implementation to reinstate the participant as active and to continue communication with the coordinator, as though the participant had been enlisted and driven to the prepared state.
However, a participant instance is still necessary for the commit or rollback process to continue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Full recovery requires the log record to contain information needed by the Web service which enlisted the participant.
This information must allow it to recreate an equivalent participant instance, which can continue the <code>commit</code> process to completion, or roll it back if some other Web Service fails to <code>prepare</code> . This information might be as simple as a String key which the participant can use to locate the data it made persistent before returning its Prepared vote.
It may be as complex as a serialized object tree containing the original participant instance and other objects created by the Web service.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a participant instance implements the relevant interface, the XTS implementation will append this participant recovery state to its log record before writing it to persistent storage.
In the event of a crash, the participant recovery state is retrieved from the log and passed to the Web Service which created it.
The Web Service uses this state to create a new participant, which the XTS implementation uses to drive the transaction to completion.
Log records are only deleted after the participant&#8217;s <code>commit</code> or <code>rollback</code> method is called.</p>

<p>When a Business Activity participant web service completes its work, it may want to save the information which will be required later to close or compensate actions performed during the activity.
The XTS implementation automatically acquires this information from the participant as part of the completion process and writes it to a participant log record.
This ensures that the information can be restored and used to recreate a copy of the participant even if the web service container crashes between the complete and close or compensate operations.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The WS-BA coordination service implementation tracks the status of each participant in an activity as the activity progresses through completion and closure.
A transition point occurs during closure, once all <code>CoordinatorCompletion</code> participants receive a <code>complete</code> message and respond with a <code>completed</code> message.
At this point, all <code>ParticipantCompletion</code> participants should have sent a <code>completed</code> message.
The coordinator writes a log record storing the details of each participant, and indicating that the transaction is ready to close.
If the coordinator service crashes after the log record is written, the <code>close</code> operation is still guaranteed to be successful.
The coordinator checks the log after the system reboots and re-sends a <code>close</code> message to all participants.
After all participants respond to the <code>close</code> with a <code>closed</code> message, the coordinator can safely delete the log entry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The coordinator does not need to account for any <code>close</code> messages sent before the crash, nor resend messages if it crashes several times.
The XTS participant implementation is resilient to redelivery of <code>close</code> messages.
Assuming that the participant has implemented the recovery functions described below, the coordinator can even guarantee delivery of <code>close</code> messages if both it, and one or more of the participant service hosts, crash simultaneously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the coordination service crashes before it has written the log record, it does not need to explicitly compensate any completed participants.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A log record does not need to be written when an activity is being canceled.
If a participant does not respond to a <code>cancel</code> or <code>compensate</code> request, the coordinator logs a warning and continues.
The combination of the presumed abort protocol and participant-led recovery ensures that all participants eventually get canceled or compensated, as appropriate, even if the participant host crashes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a completed participant does not detect a response from its coordinator after resending its <code>completed</code> response a suitable number of times, it switches to sending <code>getstatus</code> messages, to determine whether the coordinator still knows about it.
If a crash occurs before writing the log record, the coordinator has no record of the participant when the coordinator restarts, and the <code>getstatus</code> request returns a fault.
The participant recovery manager automatically compensates the participant in this situation, just as if the activity had been canceled by the client.</p>
</div>

<p>After a participant crash, the participant recovery manager detects the log entries for each completed participant.
It sends <code>getstatus</code> messages to each participant&#8217;s coordinator host, to determine whether the activity still exists.
If the coordinator has not crashed and the activity is still running, the participant switches back to resending <code>completed</code> messages, and waits for a <code>close</code> or <code>compensate</code> response.

<p>When a BA participant completes, it is expected to commit changes to the web service state made during the activity.
The web service usually also needs to persist these changes to a local storage device.
This leaves open a window where the persisted changes may not be guarded with the necessary compensation information.
The web service container may crash after the changes to the service state have been written but before the XTS implementation is able to acquire the recovery state and write a recovery log record for the participant.

<p>A participant which needs to persist changes to local web service state should implement interface <code>ConfirmCompletedParticipant</code> in package <code>com.arjuna.wst11</code>.

Delivery of this confirmation can be guaranteed even if the web service container crashes after writing the participant log record.

<p>When the participant is ready to complete, it should prepare its persistent changes by temporarily locking access to the relevant state in the local store and writing the changed data to disk, retaining both the old and new versions of the service state.
For a Participant Completion participant, this prepare operation should be done just before calling the participant manager&#8217;s <code>completed</code> method.
For a Coordinator Completion participant, it should be done just before returning from the call to the participant&#8217;s <code>completed</code> method.
After writing the participant log record, the XTS implementation calls the participant&#8217;s <code>confirmCompleted</code> method, providing value <code>true</code> as the argument.
The participant should respond by installing the provisional state changes and releasing any locks.
If the log record cannot be written, the XTS implementation calls the participant&#8217;s <code>confirmCompleted</code> method, providing value <code>false</code> as the argument.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a crash occurs before the call to <code>confirmCompleted</code>, the application&#8217;s recovery module can make sure that the provisional changes to the web service state are rolled forward or rolled back as appropriate.
The web service must identify all provisional writes to persistent state before it starts serving new requests or processing recovered participants.
It must reobtain any locks required to ensure that the state is not changed by new transactions.
When the recovery module recovers a participant from the log, its compensation information is available.
If the participant still has prepared changes, the recovery code must call <code>confirmCompleted</code>, passing value true.
This allows the participant to finish the <code>complete</code> operation.
The XTS implementation then forwards a <code>completed</code> message to the coordinator, ensuring that the participant is subsequently notified either to close or to compensate.
At the end of the first recovery scan, the recovery module may find some prepared changes on disk which are still unaccounted for.
This means that the participant recovery record is not available.
The recovery module should restore the original state values and release any locks.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This quickstart uses JTA to manage WS-AT applications.
The quickstart is composed of a client (the test) and two Web services (<code>FirstServiceAT</code> and <code>SecondServiceAT</code>).
Both services are invoked by the test from within the same JTA transaction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Client begins a JTA transaction and then invokes an operation on each service.
Transaction context propagation is enabled by default.
Therefore XTS automatically bridges the JTA transaction to a WS-AT transaction before each invocation is made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each service uses JPA to persist its data (the value of a counter).
Therefore, the service class is annotated with <code>jakarta.ejb.TransactionAttribute</code> which tells XTS to automatically bridge WS-AT transaction to JTA.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Transactions provide a structuring mechanism for business logic.
Use of transactions allows for grouping of data manipulations into constructs with certain properties.
Traditional ACID transactions provide for properties of Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In JavaEE applications, transaction support is provided via the Java Transaction API (JTA).
The classes and interfaces in the <code>jakarta.transaction</code> and <code>javax.transaction.xa</code> packages provide a means by which the programmer may manage transaction demarcation (<code>begin</code>, <code>commit</code>, <code>rollback</code>) and, where necessary, interact with the transaction management system (e.g. <code>enlistResource</code>).
In many JavaEE applications, further abstractions are provided on top of the JTA.
For example, EJB3 <code>@TransactionAttribute</code> annotations may be used for transaction boundary demarcation in preference to explicit calls to the JTA&#8217;s UserTransaction interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In distributed applications, the JTA implementation may provide propagation of transaction context and transaction control calls between containers (JVMs) using either a propriety transport or JTS, the Java mapping of the CORBA OTS standard on an RMI/IIOP transport.
In Narayana, both local and distributed (JTS) implementations of the JTA are available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Web Services applications, ACID transaction management and interoperable context propagation is provided for by the WS-AT standard.
Narayana XTS provides an implementation of both the 1.1 and 1.2 versions of this standard.
Bridging is provided only on the more recent version.
At the time of writing the standard covers only the web services API and protocol, not the Java API through which the protocol may be driven.
Therefore, XTS provides a custom Java API to users, with characteristics broadly similar to the JTA.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For applications that combine traditional JavaEE transaction management and Web Service transaction management, it is often desirable to have some mechanism for linking these transaction types, such that a single transaction may span business logic written for either transaction type.
Examples include exposing existing JavaEE transactional business logic (e.g. EJBs) as transactional Web Services, or allowing JavaEE transactional components to utilize transactional Web Services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_transaction_bridging"><a class="anchor" href="#_transaction_bridging"></a>5.1.2. Transaction Bridging</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use the term Transaction Bridging to describe the process of linking the JavaEE and Web Services transaction domains.
The transaction bridge component (txbridge) of Narayana provides bi-directional linkage, such that either type of transaction may encompass business logic designed for use with the other type.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The technique used by the bridge is a combination of interposition and protocol mapping.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Interposition is used in transaction systems to allow a tree of transaction coordinators to be constructed, usually for performance reasons.
Interposed coordinators function as transaction managers for nodes below them in the tree, whilst appearing as resources (participants in WS-AT terminology) to the node above them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within a single transaction domain, interposition may be used to allow remote nodes to minimize the number of network calls necessary at transaction termination.
The top level node is known as the root coordinator, whilst interposed coordinators are termed subordinate.
This name indicates that they are not autonomously responsible for determining the transaction outcome, but rather are driven by their parent coordinator.
Therefore, whilst a top level coordinator exposes only the <code>commit</code> and <code>rollback</code> methods for transaction termination and handles the 2PC internally, the subordinates additionally expose the prepare method to their parent, behaving much like resources during the termination protocol.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 13. Transaction interposition in a distributed JTA environment</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the transaction bridge, an interposed coordinator is registered into the existing transaction and performs the additional task of protocol mapping.
That is, it appears to its parent coordinator to be a resource of its native transaction type, whilst appearing to its children to be a coordinator of their native transaction type, even though these transaction types differ.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock text-center">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 14. Transactional bridging interposition</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The interposed coordinator is responsible for performing mapping between the transaction protocols.
There is a strong correspondence between the API and protocol used by the JTA and WS-AT transaction types, which is unsurprising given their common heritage and shared problem domain.
However, method signatures, exception types and such do differ.
The bridge provides a abstraction layer to mask these distinctions as far as possible.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The net result of this is that existing business logic perceives its expected transaction environment, even though the transaction in which it is executing may be subordinate to one of a different type.
No changes are necessary to existing transactional applications to allow them to operate in the scope of foreign transactions.
This facilitates reuse of existing business logic components in new environments and increases the possibilities for new architectures and interoperability.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_overview_2"><a class="anchor" href="#_overview_2"></a>5.2.1. Overview</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The transaction bridge resides in the package <code>org.jboss.jbossts.txbridge</code> and its <code>subpackages.</code>.
It consists of two distinct sets of classes, one for bridging in each direction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process of inflowing a WS-AT transaction context on a Web Service call into the container and converting it to a local JTA transaction context such that existing transactional JavaEE code (e.g. EJBs) may be called within its scope, is termed Inbound Transaction Bridging.
When using inbound bridging, a parent WS-AT transaction coordinator has a subordinate JTA coordinator interposed into it via the transaction bridge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process of outflowing a WS-AT transaction context on a call to a transactional Web Service from a business logic method operating in a JavaEE transaction scope, is termed Outbound Transaction Bridging.
When using outbound bridging, a parent JTA transaction coordinator has a subordinate WS-AT coordinator interposed into it via the transaction bridge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purpose of understanding this naming convention, it is simplest to view the JTA as being local to the container in which it operates, whilst the Web Service protocol provides for transaction context propagation between servers.
This is an accurate representation of the situation that exists where the local JTA version of Narayana is being used alongside Narayana XTS in an application server.
However, it is an oversimplification of the situation where the JTS option is used.
We will return to this case later.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The design of the inbound and outbound bridges is conceptually very similar.
Each provides the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>A <code>BridgeManager</code>, essentially a factory singleton, providing a means of managing <code>Bridge</code> and resource/participant instances.
The chief role of the <code>BridgeManager</code> is to ensure a distinct mapping of a parent transaction context to a single <code>Bridge</code> and resource/participant instance.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <code>Bridge</code>, which provides Thread to transaction context association and disassociation functions for the subordinate transaction.
The <code>Bridge</code> is usually called from the <code>Handler</code>, but may optionally be driven directly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <code>Handler</code>, which is registered into the JAX-WS processing pipeline to provide minimally invasive management of Thread to transaction context bindings via the <code>Bridge</code>, an appropriate instance of which it obtains from the <code>BridgeManager</code>.
Whilst the bridge provides handlers only for JAX-WS, it&#8217;s possible to use these as a model for the implementation of JAX-RPC versions if desired.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <code>VolatileParticipant</code> and <code>DurableParticipant</code> (in the case of the InboundBridge) or <code>Synchronization</code> and <code>XAResource</code> (in the case of the OutboundBridge) which are enlisted into the parent transaction and wrap the Subordinate transaction coordinator, providing mapping of the transaction termination protocol operations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A <code>RecoveryManager</code>, which is responsible for automatically restoring the state of crashed transactions and allowing them to complete correctly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_inbound_bridging"><a class="anchor" href="#_inbound_bridging"></a>5.2.3. Inbound Bridging</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process flow when using the inbound bridge is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A remote client starts a WS-AT transaction and invokes a transactional Web Service in the scope of that transaction.
The inbound WS invocation therefore has SOAP headers containing the WS-AT transaction context.
The coordinator used for this transaction is the root coordinator.
It may be remote from either or both of the client and the service it is invoking.
The client needs access to a WS-AT implementation, but not a JTA or the transaction bridge deployed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The call arrives at a web service container, which must have Narayana JTA or JTS, XTS and the transaction bridge deployed.
The JAX-WS handler chain for the web service should have both the XTS WS-AT transaction header processor and the inbound bridge handler registered, such that they are invoked in that order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The transaction header processor takes the WS-AT transaction context from XML, creates a corresponding WS-AT TxContext and associates it to the Thread.
The bridge handler calls the <code>InboundBridgeManager</code> to obtain an <code>InboundBridge</code> instance corresponding to the TxContext.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As the <code>BridgeManager</code> is seeing the TxContext for the first time, it creates a new <code>Bridge</code> instance.
It also creates a new <code>Bridge</code>, <code>VolatileParticipant</code>, and <code>DurableParticipant</code> and registers them with the WS-AT transaction coordinator.
These <code>Participants</code> wrap a subordinate JTA transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bridge header processor starts the bridge, which associates the JTA subordinate transaction context to the Thread.
At this point the Thread has transaction contexts for both WS-AT and JTA.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The JAX-WS pipeline processing continues, eventually calling whatever business logic is exposed.
This may be e.g. an EJB using JSR-181 annotations.
The business logic may use the JTA transaction in the normal manner e.g. enlisting Synchronizations and <code>XAResources</code> or performing other transactional activity either directly or though the usual JavaEE abstractions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the return path, the bridge header processor disassociates the JTA transaction context from the Thread via the <code>Bridge</code>.
The XTS context processor then does likewise for the WS-AT TxContext.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On subsequent web services calls to the same or other web services from the same client, the process is repeated.
However, the <code>BridgeManager</code> will, upon seeing the same WS-AT transaction context again, return the existing <code>Bridge</code> instance and not register further Participant instances.
This allows substantially better performance than registering one Participant per web service invocation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon transaction termination by the client, the WS-AT transaction coordinator will drive the enlisted bridge <code>Participants</code> through the transaction termination protocol.
The <code>Participants</code> maps these calls down to the JTA subtransaction coordinator, which in turn passes them on to any Synchronizations or <code>XAResources</code> enlisted in the transaction.
This process is not visible to the business logic, except in so far as it may have registered its own Synchronizations, <code>XAResources</code> or <code>Participants</code> with the transaction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_outbound_bridging"><a class="anchor" href="#_outbound_bridging"></a>5.2.4. Outbound Bridging</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The process flow when using the outbound bridge is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>A client starts a JTA transaction and invokes a remote transactional Web Service in the scope of that transaction.
The client must have Narayana JTA (or JTS) and XTS deployed, as well as the transaction bridge.
The coordinator used for the JTA transaction is the root coordinator.
The server hosting the target web service needs a WS-AT transaction implementation but not a JTA or the transaction bridge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The outbound WS invocation flows though a handler chain that has the outbound transaction bridge handler and XTS header context processor registered, such that they are invoked in that order.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bridge handler calls the outbound bridge manager to obtain an outbound bridge instance corresponding to the JTA transaction context.
As the <code>BridgeManager</code> is seeing the context for the first time, it creates a new <code>Bridge</code> instance.
It also creates a <code>Synchronization</code> and <code>XAResource</code> instance to wrap the subordinate WS-AT transaction and registers these with the JTA transaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bridge handler starts the bridge, which associates the subordinate WS-AT transaction context to the Thread.
The WS-AT header context processor then serializes this into XML in the headers of the outbound Web Services call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The receiving Web Service sees a WS-AT context and can work with it in the normal manner, without knowing it is a subordinate context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the return path, the bridge handler disassociates the WS-AT TxContext from the Thread via the <code>Bridge</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On subsequent calls to the same or other transactional Web Services in the scope of the same JTA transaction, the process is repeated.
However, the <code>BridgeManager</code> will, upon seeing the same JTA transaction context again, return the existing <code>Bridge</code> and not register another <code>Synchronization</code> or <code>XAResource</code> with the parent JTA transaction.
This allows substantially better performance than registering once per web service invocation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Upon transaction termination by the client, the JTA transaction coordinator will drive the enlisted bridge <code>Synchronization</code> and <code>XAResource</code> through the transaction termination protocol.
The <code>XAResource</code> maps these calls down to the WS-AT subtransaction coordinator, which in turn passes them on to any Volatile or Durable <code>Participants</code> enlisted in the transaction.
This process is not visible to the business logic, except in so far as it may have registered its own <code>Participants</code>, <code>XAResources</code> or <code>Synchronizatons</code> with the transaction.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_crash_recovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_crash_recovery"></a>5.2.5. Crash Recovery</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The bridge includes independent crash recovery systems for the inbound and outbound sides.
These are automatically installed and activated as part of the bridge deployment.
They rely upon the recovery mechanisms in the JTA and XTS components, which are likewise deployed and activated by default as part of their respective components.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is the responsibility of the application(s) to use suitable <code>XAResources</code> (inbound) or <code>DurableParticipants</code> (outbound).
In general the former will be from XA datasources or messaging systems, whilst the latter will be custom implementations.
In either case it is important to ensure recovery is correctly configured for the resource manager(s) before using them in production, via the bridge or otherwise.
The Narayana documentation set details crash recovery configuration, as does the application server administration guide.
For resource manager specific information e.g. Oracle db permissions settings for recovery connections, please consult the vendor&#8217;s documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A bridged transaction will involve several distinct log writes, potentially on multiple hosts.
Resolving the transaction may require more than one crash recovery cycle, due to ordering constrains on the events taking place during recovery.
If a transaction fails to recover after all servers have been restored to service for more than two recovery cycles duration, the Narayana objectstore browser and server logs may be useful for diagnosing the issue.
Where a transaction involves multiple bridges the number of recovery cycles required to resolve it may further increase.
For systems requiring maximum availability it is therefore not recommended to span a transaction through more than one bridge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the 1PC commit optimization should not be used with outbound bridged transactions in which the subordinate may contain more than one Participant.
Even where only one Participant is used, crash recovery logs may not correctly reflect the actual transaction outcome.
The 1PC optimization is on be default and may be disabled by setting <code>&lt;property name="commitOnePhase"&gt;false &lt;/property&gt;</code> on <code>CoordinatorEnvironmentBean</code>.</p>

<h4 id="_loops_and_diamonds"><a class="anchor" href="#_loops_and_diamonds"></a>5.3.5. Loops and Diamonds</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In distributed environments that utilize transaction bridging, it is possible to construct arrangements of servers such that a transaction context passes though more than one interposition.
These can give rise to some undesirable issues, including locking and performance problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple case would be a loop in which a JTA transaction context is bridged outbound to a WS-AT context, passed though one or more remote servers and inflowed back to the original server through an inbound bridge.
This may result in a new subordinate JTA context, rather than reuse of the existing parent context in the original server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This situation has two main observable effects.
Firstly, the parent JTA transaction and indirectly subordinate JTA transaction are considered distinct and <code>XAResources</code> may not be shared between them.
In most cases this will cause isolation between the transactions, such that they do not share locks or see eachother&#8217;s changes.
This may cause deadlocks in the application.
Secondly, performance will be poor relative to reuse of the original context, particularly if the interposition chain becomes long.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A similar problem exists where a transaction context is propagated from a single source to a single destination server via two or more separate routes, the abstract paths forming a diamond shape.
In such case the intermediate nodes operate independently and will bridge the original context to two separate interposed contexts.
To the destination server these will appear unrelated, rather than as representations of the same transaction.
Thus instead of recombining into a single shared transaction context at the destination, they will behave as different transactions, giving rise once again to potential deadlock and performance issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These problems may be partially addressed by having a shared context mapping service available on the network, which each bridge consults when working with a previously unseen transaction context for the first time.
Using such a mechanism, bridge instances may identify transactions for which an established mapping already exists and reuse that relationship rather than creating a new one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This shared service model does however cause some issues of its own with regard to performance and availability.
It is not currently implemented.
Therefore, users are urged to be cautious when constructing distributed applications.
Whilst location abstraction is sometimes desirable, is is important to maintain a clear understanding of the deployment relationships between transactional components in the system.</p>

<h4 id="_distributed_jta_and_the_jts"><a class="anchor" href="#_distributed_jta_and_the_jts"></a>5.3.6. Distributed JTA and the JTS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The JavaEE transaction engine in Narayana comes in two varieties.
These are the local only JTA, which does not support propagation of transaction context or transaction control calls between JVMs and the JTAX, which provides the JTA API implemented by a JTS engine that does support distributed usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WildFly Application Server</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>uses the local JTA implementation by default, but can be reconfigured to use the JTS via the JTA API, such that it supports distributed transactions without requiring any changes to business applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In environments requiring transaction propagation of JTA transactions, it is feasible to use either the JTS or an outbound and inbound bridge pair to achieve this.
In the former case the transport is RMI/IIOP for the transaction control and RMI/IIOP or JRMP for the transactional business logic calls.
In the latter case the transport is Web Services for both transaction control and business logic.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From a transaction management perspective the JTS solution is preferred, due to simplicity (no protocol mapping is needed), maturity (Narayana JTS was the world&#8217;s first JTS implementation and has been extensively used and tested in production environments) and performance (binary vs. xml).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is possible to use transactions that propagate context on some calls via JTS and on others via Web Services, such as a client invoking both EJBs via RMI/IIOP and Web services with WS-AT context.
In such cases it&#8217;s possible for a transaction to have multiple representations that the infrastructure cannot determine are related, even if they actually represent different contexts in the same interposition hierarchy.
Care must therefore be taken to avoid the problems described previously in 'Loops and Diamonds'.</p>

<p>The transaction bridge uses the jboss-logging system.
When running inside WildFly Application Server, logging is configured via logging subsystem&#8217;s configuration in <code>standalone-xts.xml</code> file.
To enable full logging for the transaction bridge, which may be useful for debug purposes, the following logger should be added:</p>

The Narayana logging system is discussed in detail in the accompanying documentation set, but for ease of reference the following may be used to enable verbose logging:</p>

<h3 id="_known_limitations"><a class="anchor" href="#_known_limitations"></a>5.4. Known Limitations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current transaction bridge release has the following limitations:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The bridge operates only on WS-AT 1.2, not 1.0, although XTS includes implementations of both versions of WS-AT.
Care must therefore be taken to deploy and configure the system correctly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bridge provides JAX-WS handlers only, not JAX-RPC, although it is possible to create such if required.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Long running activities that occur during the transaction termination process may cause timeouts in the transaction system, which can in turn cause inconsistent transaction outcomes or incomplete transaction termination.
To minimize this problem, it is advised to manually flush data that would otherwise be flushed by Synchronizations during termination, such as hibernate session state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A transaction context must always be present on the Thread in order for the context processors to operate correctly, as detailed previously in 'Using the Transaction Bridge'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A subordinate transaction context will be created and registered into the parent transaction unconditionally, which can cause unnecessary overhead in situations where no transactional activity takes place in the scope of the subordinate.
Care should be taken to register the bridge handlers only on methods that do require them.
In future releases this may be addressed by the use of WS-Policy or lazy initialization techniques.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Transaction mappings are local to BridgeManagers, which are singletons.
This means mappings are classloader scoped and not shared across JVMs.
This gives rise to issues where transactional resources are accessed indirectly though multiple bridges or transaction context transports, as described in 'Loops and Diamonds'.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Crash recovery is subject to certain timing issues, due to the interaction between recovery of the JTA/XA and XTS sides of the transaction.
It may take more than one crash recovery cycle for a bridged transaction to recover fully.
Note that recovery of subordinate transactions is dependent on the recovery of their parent, so care must be taken to ensure the correct recovery of any external transaction manager used in that role.
The transaction bridge does not currently provide dedicated tooling for the manual resolution of orphaned subordinates, instead relying on the general purpose objectstore maintenance tooling provided by Narayana.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note that crash recovery will not behave correctly for outbound bridged transactions if 1PC commit optimization is used in the parent JTA transaction.
This is not specific to the bridge, but rather is a generic issue with any transaction in which a single resource is an interposed subordinate coordinator.
Inbound bridges transactions are unaffected as XTS (WS-AT) does not utilize a 1PC optimization.</p>

<h4 id="_general_points"><a class="anchor" href="#_general_points"></a>5.5.1. General Points</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section records key design points relating to the bridge implementation.
The target audience for this section is software engineers maintaining or extending the transaction bridge implementation.
It is unlikely to contain material useful to users, except in so far as they wish to contribute to the project.
An in-depth knowledge of Narayana internals may be required to make sense of some parts of this appendix.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>txbridge</code> is written as far as possible as a user application layered on top of the JTA and XTS implementations.
It accesses these underlying components through standard or supported APIs as far as possible.
For example, <code>XAResource</code> is favored over <code>AbstractRecord</code>, the JCA standard <code>XATerminator</code> is used for driving subordinates and so on.
This facilitates modularity and portability.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It follows that functionality required by the bridge should first be evaluated for inclusion in one of the underlying modules, as experience has shown it is often also useful for other user applications.
For example, improvements to allows subordinate termination code portability between JTA and JTS, and support for subordinate crash recovery have benefited from this approach.
The <code>txbridge</code> remains a thin layer on top of this functionality, containing only purpose specific code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The 'loops and diamonds' problem boils down to providing deterministic, bi-directional 1:1 mapping between an Xid (which is fixed length) and a WS-AT context (which is unbounded length in the spec, although bounded for instances created by the XTS).
Consistent hashing techniques get you so far with independent operation, but the only 100% solution is to have a shared service on the network providing the mapping lookup.
Naturally this then becomes a single point of failure as well as a scalability issue.
For some scenarios it may be possible to use interceptors to propagate the Xid on the web services call as extra data, instead of trying to reproduce the mapping at the other end.
Unfortunately XA does not provide for this kind of extensibility, although CORBA does, leading to the possibility of solving the issue without a centralized approach in mixed JTS+WS-AT environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Requiring a tx context on all calls is a bit limiting, but JBossWS native lacks a WS-Policy implementation.
Things may change with the move to CXF.
This is really a wider issue with XTS, not just the bridge.</p>

<h4 id="_crash_recovery_considerations"><a class="anchor" href="#_crash_recovery_considerations"></a>5.5.2. Crash Recovery Considerations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As usual with transactions, it&#8217;s the crash recovery that provides for the most complexity.
Recovery for the inbound and outbound sides is handled independently.
Because of event ordering between recovery modules (JTA, XTS), it requires two complete cycles to resolve some of these crash recovery situations.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_inbound_crash_recovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_inbound_crash_recovery"></a>Inbound Crash Recovery</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An inbound transaction involves at least four log writes.
Top down (i.e. in reverse order of log creation) these are: The WS-AT coordinator log (assumed here to be XTS, but may be 3rd party), the XTS Participant log in the receiving server, the JCA Subordinate transaction log and at least one XA Resource Manager log (which are 3rd party e.g. Oracle).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is no separate log created by the <code>txbridge</code>.
The XTS Participant log inlines the Serializable <code>BridgeDurableParticipant</code> via its writeObject method.
Recorded state includes its identity (the Xid) and the identity of the separately logged JTA subordinate tx (a Uid).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>XTS is responsible for the top level coordinator log.
Narayana is responsible for the JTA subordinate tx log and 3rd party RMs are each responsible for their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following situations may exist at recovery time, according to the point in time at which the crash occurred:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RM log only: In this case, the <code>InboundBridgeRecoveryManager&#8217;s `XAResourceOrphanFilter</code> implementation will be invoked via Narayana <code>XARecoveryModule</code>, will recognize the orphaned Xids by their formatId (which they inherit from the JCA subordinate, which the <code>txbridge</code> previously created with a specially constructed inflowed Xid) and will vote to have the <code>XARecoveryModule</code> roll them back as no corresponding JCA subordinate log exists, so presumed abort applies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RM log and JTA subordinate tx log: The <code>InboundBridgeRecoverytManager&#8217;s scan of indoubt subordinate JTA transactions identifies the JTA subordinate as being orphaned and rolls it back, which in turn causes the rollback of the RM&#8217;s `XAResource</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RM log, JTA subordinate log and XTS Participant log: XTS is responsible for detecting that the Participant is orphaned (by re-sending Prepared to the Coordinator and receiving 'unknown tx' back) and initiating rollback under the presumed abort convention.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>WS-AT coordinator log and all downstream logs: The coordinator re-sends Commit to the Participant and the transaction completes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_outbound_crash_recovery"><a class="anchor" href="#_outbound_crash_recovery"></a>Outbound Crash Recovery</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An outbound transaction involves log writes for the JTA parent transaction and the XTS <code>BridgeWrapper</code> coordinator.
There is not a separate log created by the <code>txbridge</code>.
The JTA tx log inlines the Serializable <code>BridgeXAResource</code> via its writeObject method.
Recorded state includes the JTA tx id and <code>BridgeWrapper</code> id String.
In addition a Web Service participating in the subordinate transaction will create a log.
Assuming it&#8217;s XTS, the participant side log will inline any <code>Serializable Durable2PCParticipant</code>, effectively forming the RM log.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The following situations may exist at recovery time, according to the point in time at which the crash occurred:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RM log (i.e. XTS Participant log, inlining <code>Serializable Durable2PCParticipant</code>) only: XTS is responsible for detecting that the Participant is orphaned (its direct parent, the subordinate coordinator, is missing) and rolling it back.
The bridge recovery code is not involved – XTS recovery deserializes and drives any app DurableParticipants directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RM log and XTS subordinate log: The <code>DurableParticipant</code>(s) (i.e. client side) and XTS subordinate coordinator / <code>BridgeWrapper</code> (i.e. server side) and reinstantiated by XTS.
The <code>BridgeWrapper</code>, being subordinate to a missing parent, must be identified and explicitly rolledback by the bridge recovery code.
The bridge recovery manager is itself a RecoveryModule, thus invoked periodically to perform this task.
It identified its own <code>BridgeWrapper</code> instance from amongst all those awaiting recovery by means of an id prefix specific to the <code>txbridge</code> code.
See <code>JBTM-725</code> for further details.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>RM log, XTS subordinate log and JTA parent log (with inlined <code>BridgeXAResource</code>): Top down recovery by the JTA recovery module drives tx to completion, taking the normal JTA parent&#8594;`BridgeXAResource`&#8594;XTS subordinate&#8594;`DurableParticipant` path.
Note that if the bridge is the only <code>XAResource</code> in the parent, the JTA must have 1PC commit optimization disabled or it won&#8217;t write a log for recovery.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_test_framework"><a class="anchor" href="#_test_framework"></a>5.5.3. Test framework</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The test suite for the <code>txbridge</code> is split along two axis.
Firstly, the inbound and outbound sides of the bridge have their own test suites in a parallel code package hierarchy.
These are largely mirrors, containing tests which have matching intent but different implementation details.
Secondly, the tests are split between those for normal execution and those for crash recovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The tests use a framework consisting of a basic servlet acting as client (the code pre-dates the availability of XTS lightweight client), a basic web service as server and a set of utility classes implementing the appropriate interfaces (<code>Participant</code>/<code>Synchronization</code>/<code>XAResource</code>).
These classes contain the bare minimum of test logic.
In order to make the tests as easy to understand and modify as possible, an attempt is made to capture the entirety of the test logic within the junit test function instead of splitting it over the framework classes.
To facilitate this, extensive use is made of byteman and its associated dtest library, which provides basic distributed mock-like execution tracing and configuration.
You probably need to take a detour and read the dtest docs before proceeding further.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic tests all follow the same pattern: make a call through the bridge, following different logic paths in each test, and verify that the test resources see the expected method calls.
For example, in a test that runs a transaction successfully, expect to see commit called on enlisted resources and rollback not called.
For a test that configures the prepare to fail, expect to see rollback called and commit not called.
The tests verify behavior in the presence of 'expected' errors e.g. prepare failures, but generally don&#8217;t cover unexpected failures e.g. exceptions thrown from commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Test normal execution targets in the <code>tests/build.xml</code> assume the server is started manually with byteman installed and has XTS, <code>txbridge</code> and the test artifacts deployed.
Note that it also contains targets that may be called to achieve the last of these steps.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The crash rec tests start (and subsequently restart) the server automatically, but assume the that XTS, <code>txbridge</code> and the test artifacts are deployed.
To manage the server they need to be provided with <code>JBOSS_HOME</code> and <code>JAVA_HOME</code> values in the <code>build.xml</code>.</p>
