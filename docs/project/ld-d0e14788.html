                        The diagram shows a
                        <em class="firstterm">top-level coordinator</em>
                        and an
                        <em class="firstterm">interposed
                            coordinator
                        </em>
                        . The top-level coordinator is responsible for driving the original, top-level transaction
                        to completion or rollback. The interposed coordinator manages its participants in a subordinate transaction, but
                        it cannot act autonomously. From the point of view of the parent coordinator, it appears to be another
                        participant in the top-level transaction. The interposed coordinator operates as an intermediary. It forwards
                        incoming
                        <code class="systemitem">prepare</code>
                        and
                        <code class="systemitem">commit</code>
                        /
                        <code class="systemitem">rollback</code>
                        messages to its participants, combining their responses and returning them back to its parent
                        coordinator.
