                        Whenever an application message is sent, the XTS Client API automatically creates a context and embeds it into
                        the message. Similarly, any transaction-aware services can extract that context using the XTS service-side
                        infrastructure and use it to perform work within the context of a particular transaction, even
                        if that
                        transaction was initiated elsewhere on the Web. The value of this approach is that the business logic contained
                        within the client application and services are not peppered with transaction-processing code.
