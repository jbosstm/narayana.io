Similarly, any transaction-aware services can extract that context using the XTS service-side infrastructure and use it to perform work within the context of a particular transaction, even if that transaction was initiated elsewhere on the Web. The value of this approach is that the business logic contained within the client application and services are not peppered with transaction-processing code. </p></body></html>
